1532,Duke of Burgundy.
1532,Duke of Cornwall.
1532,Duke of Albany.
1532,Earl of Kent.

1532,"Scene,--Britain."
1532,
1532,
1532,
1532,ACT I.
1532,
1532,Scene I. A Room of State in King Lear's Palace.
1532,
1532,"[Enter Kent, Gloster, and Edmund.]"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than
1532,Cornwall.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the"
1532,"kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for"
1532,equalities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make
1532,choice of either's moiety.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Is not this your son, my lord?"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often"
1532,blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,I cannot conceive you.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon she grew"
1532,"round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she"
1532,had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than"
1532,"this, who yet is no dearer in my account: though this knave came"
1532,"something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was"
1532,"his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the"
1532,"whoreson must be acknowledged.--Do you know this noble gentleman,"
1532,Edmund?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"No, my lord."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,My Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,My services to your lordship.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"I must love you, and sue to know you better."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Sir, I shall study deserving."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.--The king"
1532,is coming.
1532,
1532,[Sennet within.]
1532,
1532,"[Enter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, and"
1532,Attendants.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,"
1532,Gloster.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"I shall, my liege."
1532,
1532,[Exeunt Gloster and Edmund.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.--
1532,Give me the map there.--Know that we have divided
1532,In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
1532,To shake all cares and business from our age;
1532,"Conferring them on younger strengths, while we"
1532,"Unburden'd crawl toward death.--Our son of Cornwall,"
1532,"And you, our no less loving son of Albany,"
1532,We have this hour a constant will to publish
1532,"Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife"
1532,"May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,"
1532,"Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,"
1532,"Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,"
1532,"And here are to be answer'd.--Tell me, my daughters,--"
1532,"Since now we will divest us both of rule,"
1532,"Interest of territory, cares of state,--"
1532,Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
1532,That we our largest bounty may extend
1532,"Where nature doth with merit challenge.--Goneril,"
1532,"Our eldest-born, speak first."
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;"
1532,"Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;"
1532,"Beyond what can be valu'd, rich or rare;"
1532,"No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;"
1532,"As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;"
1532,A love that makes breath poor and speech unable;
1532,Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"[Aside.] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,"
1532,"With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,"
1532,"With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,"
1532,We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
1532,"Be this perpetual.--What says our second daughter,"
1532,"Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak."
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"Sir, I am made of the selfsame metal that my sister is,"
1532,And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
1532,I find she names my very deed of love;
1532,"Only she comes too short,--that I profess"
1532,Myself an enemy to all other joys
1532,"Which the most precious square of sense possesses,"
1532,And find I am alone felicitate
1532,In your dear highness' love.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,[Aside.] Then poor Cordelia!
1532,"And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's"
1532,More richer than my tongue.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,To thee and thine hereditary ever
1532,Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
1532,"No less in space, validity, and pleasure"
1532,"Than that conferr'd on Goneril.--Now, our joy,"
1532,"Although the last, not least; to whose young love"
1532,The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
1532,Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
1532,A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"Nothing, my lord."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Nothing!
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,Nothing.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Nothing can come of nothing: speak again.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave"
1532,My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
1532,According to my bond; no more nor less.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"How, how, Cordelia? mend your speech a little,"
1532,Lest you may mar your fortunes.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"Good my lord,"
1532,"You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me: I"
1532,"Return those duties back as are right fit,"
1532,"Obey you, love you, and most honour you."
1532,Why have my sisters husbands if they say
1532,"They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,"
1532,That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
1532,"Half my love with him, half my care and duty:"
1532,"Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,"
1532,To love my father all.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,But goes thy heart with this?
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"Ay, good my lord."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"So young, and so untender?"
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"So young, my lord, and true."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Let it be so,--thy truth then be thy dower:"
1532,"For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,"
1532,"The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;"
1532,"By all the operation of the orbs,"
1532,From whom we do exist and cease to be;
1532,"Here I disclaim all my paternal care,"
1532,"Propinquity, and property of blood,"
1532,And as a stranger to my heart and me
1532,"Hold thee, from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,"
1532,Or he that makes his generation messes
1532,"To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom"
1532,"Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,"
1532,As thou my sometime daughter.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Good my liege,--"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Peace, Kent!"
1532,Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
1532,"I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest"
1532,"On her kind nursery.--Hence, and avoid my sight!--[To Cordelia.]"
1532,"So be my grave my peace, as here I give"
1532,Her father's heart from her!--Call France;--who stirs?
1532,"Call Burgundy!--Cornwall and Albany,"
1532,With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
1532,"Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her."
1532,"I do invest you jointly in my power,"
1532,"Pre-eminence, and all the large effects"
1532,"That troop with majesty.--Ourself, by monthly course,"
1532,"With reservation of an hundred knights,"
1532,"By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode"
1532,Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
1532,"The name, and all the additions to a king;"
1532,"The sway,"
1532,"Revenue, execution of the rest,"
1532,"Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,"
1532,This coronet part betwixt you.
1532,[Giving the crown.]
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Royal Lear,"
1532,"Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,"
1532,"Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,"
1532,As my great patron thought on in my prayers.--
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Let it fall rather, though the fork invade"
1532,The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly
1532,"When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?"
1532,Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
1532,When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound
1532,When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy state;
1532,And in thy best consideration check
1532,"This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,"
1532,Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
1532,Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
1532,Reverbs no hollowness.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Kent, on thy life, no more."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,My life I never held but as a pawn
1532,"To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,"
1532,Thy safety being the motive.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Out of my sight!
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"See better, Lear; and let me still remain"
1532,The true blank of thine eye.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Now, by Apollo,--"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Now by Apollo, king,"
1532,Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,O vassal! miscreant!
1532,
1532,[Laying his hand on his sword.]
1532,
1532,Alb. and Corn.
1532,"Dear sir, forbear!"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Do;
1532,"Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow"
1532,"Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,"
1532,"Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,"
1532,I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Hear me, recreant!"
1532,"On thine allegiance, hear me!--"
1532,"Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,--"
1532,"Which we durst never yet,--and with strain'd pride"
1532,"To come between our sentence and our power,--"
1532,"Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,--"
1532,"Our potency made good, take thy reward."
1532,Five days we do allot thee for provision
1532,To shield thee from diseases of the world;
1532,And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
1532,"Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,"
1532,"Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,"
1532,"The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,"
1532,This shall not be revok'd.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,"
1532,"Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.--"
1532,"[To Cordelia.] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,"
1532,That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!
1532,[To Regan and Goneril.]
1532,"And your large speeches may your deeds approve,"
1532,That good effects may spring from words of love.--
1532,"Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;"
1532,He'll shape his old course in a country new.
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,"[Flourish. Re-enter Gloster, with France, Burgundy, and"
1532,Attendants.]
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"My Lord of Burgundy,"
1532,"We first address toward you, who with this king"
1532,Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what in the least
1532,"Will you require in present dower with her,"
1532,Or cease your quest of love?
1532,
1532,Bur.
1532,"Most royal majesty,"
1532,"I crave no more than hath your highness offer'd,"
1532,Nor will you tender less.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Right noble Burgundy,"
1532,"When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;"
1532,"But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:"
1532,"If aught within that little seeming substance,"
1532,"Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,"
1532,"And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,"
1532,"She's there, and she is yours."
1532,
1532,Bur.
1532,I know no answer.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Will you, with those infirmities she owes,"
1532,"Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,"
1532,"Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,"
1532,"Take her, or leave her?"
1532,
1532,Bur.
1532,"Pardon me, royal sir;"
1532,Election makes not up on such conditions.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,"
1532,"I tell you all her wealth.--[To France] For you, great king,"
1532,I would not from your love make such a stray
1532,To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
1532,To avert your liking a more worthier way
1532,Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
1532,Almost to acknowledge hers.
1532,
1532,France.
1532,"This is most strange,"
1532,"That she, who even but now was your best object,"
1532,"The argument of your praise, balm of your age,"
1532,"Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time"
1532,"Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle"
1532,So many folds of favour. Sure her offence
1532,Must be of such unnatural degree
1532,"That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection"
1532,Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her
1532,Must be a faith that reason without miracle
1532,Should never plant in me.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"I yet beseech your majesty,--"
1532,If for I want that glib and oily art
1532,"To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,"
1532,"I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known"
1532,"It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,"
1532,"No unchaste action or dishonour'd step,"
1532,That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;
1532,"But even for want of that for which I am richer,--"
1532,"A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue"
1532,"As I am glad I have not, though not to have it"
1532,Hath lost me in your liking.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Better thou
1532,Hadst not been born than not to have pleas'd me better.
1532,
1532,France.
1532,"Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature"
1532,Which often leaves the history unspoke
1532,"That it intends to do?--My lord of Burgundy,"
1532,What say you to the lady? Love's not love
1532,When it is mingled with regards that stands
1532,Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
1532,She is herself a dowry.
1532,
1532,Bur.
1532,"Royal king,"
1532,"Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,"
1532,"And here I take Cordelia by the hand,"
1532,Duchess of Burgundy.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
1532,
1532,Bur.
1532,"I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father"
1532,That you must lose a husband.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,Peace be with Burgundy!
1532,"Since that respects of fortune are his love,"
1532,I shall not be his wife.
1532,
1532,France.
1532,"Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;"
1532,"Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!"
1532,Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
1532,"Be it lawful, I take up what's cast away."
1532,"Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect"
1532,My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.--
1532,"Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,"
1532,"Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:"
1532,Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
1532,Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.--
1532,"Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:"
1532,"Thou losest here, a better where to find."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we"
1532,"Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see"
1532,That face of hers again.--Therefore be gone
1532,"Without our grace, our love, our benison.--"
1532,"Come, noble Burgundy."
1532,
1532,"[Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, Cornwall, Albany, Gloster,"
1532,and Attendants.]
1532,
1532,France.
1532,Bid farewell to your sisters.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes"
1532,Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
1532,"And, like a sister, am most loath to call"
1532,Your faults as they are nam'd. Love well our father:
1532,To your professed bosoms I commit him:
1532,"But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,"
1532,I would prefer him to a better place.
1532,"So, farewell to you both."
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,Prescribe not us our duties.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,Let your study
1532,"Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you"
1532,"At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,"
1532,And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides:
1532,"Who cover faults, at last shame them derides."
1532,Well may you prosper!
1532,
1532,France.
1532,"Come, my fair Cordelia."
1532,
1532,[Exeunt France and Cordelia.]
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly"
1532,appertains to us both. I think our father will hence to-night.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"That's most certain, and with you; next month with us."
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,You see how full of changes his age is; the observation we
1532,have made of it hath not been little: he always loved our
1532,sister most; and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her
1532,off appears too grossly.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever but slenderly
1532,known himself.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must
1532,"we look to receive from his age, not alone the imperfections of"
1532,"long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness"
1532,that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of
1532,Kent's banishment.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and
1532,him. Pray you let us hit together: if our father carry authority
1532,"with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his"
1532,will but offend us.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,We shall further think of it.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"We must do something, and i' th' heat."
1532,

1532,Scene II.  A Hall in the Earl of Gloster's Castle.
1532,
1532,[Enter Edmund with a letter.]
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law"
1532,My services are bound. Wherefore should I
1532,"Stand in the plague of custom, and permit"
1532,"The curiosity of nations to deprive me,"
1532,For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
1532,Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
1532,"When my dimensions are as well compact,"
1532,"My mind as generous, and my shape as true"
1532,As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
1532,"With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?"
1532,"Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take"
1532,More composition and fierce quality
1532,"Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,"
1532,Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops
1532,"Got 'tween asleep and wake?--Well then,"
1532,"Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:"
1532,Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
1532,As to the legitimate: fine word--legitimate!
1532,"Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,"
1532,"And my invention thrive, Edmund the base"
1532,Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper.--
1532,"Now, gods, stand up for bastards!"
1532,
1532,[Enter Gloster.]
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!
1532,And the king gone to-night! subscrib'd his pow'r!
1532,Confin'd to exhibition! All this done
1532,"Upon the gad!--Edmund, how now! What news?"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"So please your lordship, none."
1532,
1532,[Putting up the letter.]
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"I know no news, my lord."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,What paper were you reading?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Nothing, my lord."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of it into your"
1532,pocket? the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself.
1532,Let's see.
1532,"Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother"
1532,"that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I have perus'd,"
1532,I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Give me the letter, sir."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as in"
1532,"part I understand them, are to blame."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Let's see, let's see!"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as an"
1532,essay or taste of my virtue.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,[Reads.] 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world
1532,bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us
1532,till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle
1532,"and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways,"
1532,"not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that"
1532,of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I
1532,"waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live"
1532,"the beloved of your brother,"
1532,'EDGAR.'
1532,"Hum! Conspiracy?--'Sleep till I waked him,--you should enjoy half"
1532,his revenue.'--My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a heart
1532,and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? who brought it?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"It was not brought me, my lord, there's the cunning of it; I"
1532,found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,You know the character to be your brother's?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but"
1532,"in respect of that, I would fain think it were not."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,It is his.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the"
1532,contents.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Hath he never before sounded you in this business?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit"
1532,"that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declined, the father"
1532,"should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"O villain, villain!--His very opinion in the letter! Abhorred"
1532,"villain!--Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than"
1532,"brutish!--Go, sirrah, seek him; I'll apprehend him. Abominable"
1532,villain!--Where is he?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend"
1532,your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
1532,"better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course;"
1532,"where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his"
1532,"purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour, and shake"
1532,in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
1532,for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
1532,"honour, and to no other pretence of danger."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Think you so?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall"
1532,"hear us confer of this, and by an auricular assurance have your"
1532,satisfaction;
1532,and that without any further delay than this very evening.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,He cannot be such a monster.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Nor is not, sure."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.--Heaven"
1532,"and earth!--Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you:"
1532,frame the business after your own wisdom. I would unstate myself
1532,to be in a due resolution.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall"
1532,"find means, and acquaint you withal."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us:
1532,"though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet"
1532,"nature finds itself scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,"
1532,"friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in"
1532,"countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond cracked"
1532,'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the
1532,prediction; there's son against father: the king falls from
1532,bias of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the
1532,"best of our time: machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all"
1532,ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves.--Find out
1532,"this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it"
1532,carefully.--And the noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
1532,"offence, honesty!--'Tis strange."
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are"
1532,"sick in fortune,--often the surfeit of our own behaviour,--we"
1532,"make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as"
1532,if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
1532,"knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;"
1532,"drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of"
1532,"planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine"
1532,"thrusting on: an admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his"
1532,goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father compounded
1532,"with my mother under the dragon's tail, and my nativity was under"
1532,ursa major; so that it follows I am rough and lecherous.--Tut! I
1532,"should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the"
1532,firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.
1532,
1532,[Enter Edgar.]
1532,
1532,"Pat!--he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy: my cue"
1532,"is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam.--O,"
1532,"these eclipses do portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"How now, brother Edmund! what serious contemplation are you in?"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day,"
1532,what should follow these eclipses.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Do you busy yourself with that?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of"
1532,"unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth,"
1532,"dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and"
1532,"maledictions against king and nobles; needless diffidences,"
1532,"banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches,"
1532,and I know not what.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Come, come! when saw you my father last?"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,The night gone by.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Spake you with him?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Ay, two hours together."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by word
1532,or countenance?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,None at all.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him: and at my
1532,entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
1532,qualified the heat of his displeasure; which at this instant so
1532,rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
1532,scarcely allay.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Some villain hath done me wrong.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till the
1532,"speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to"
1532,"my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord"
1532,"speak: pray you, go; there's my key.--If you do stir abroad, go"
1532,armed.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Armed, brother!"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Brother, I advise you to the best; I am no honest man"
1532,if there be any good meaning toward you: I have told you what I
1532,have seen and heard but faintly; nothing like the image and
1532,"horror of it: pray you, away!"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Shall I hear from you anon?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,I do serve you in this business.
1532,
1532,[Exit Edgar.]
1532,
1532,"A credulous father! and a brother noble,"
1532,Whose nature is so far from doing harms
1532,That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
1532,My practices ride easy!--I see the business.
1532,"Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:"
1532,All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.

1532,
1532,[Enter Goneril and Oswald.]
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
1532,
1532,"Osw. Ay, madam."
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"By day and night, he wrongs me; every hour"
1532,"He flashes into one gross crime or other,"
1532,That sets us all at odds; I'll not endure it:
1532,"His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us"
1532,"On every trifle.--When he returns from hunting,"
1532,I will not speak with him; say I am sick.--
1532,"If you come slack of former services,"
1532,You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"He's coming, madam; I hear him."
1532,
1532,[Horns within.]
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Put on what weary negligence you please,"
1532,You and your fellows; I'd have it come to question:
1532,"If he distaste it, let him to our sister,"
1532,"Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,"
1532,"Not to be overruled. Idle old man,"
1532,That still would manage those authorities
1532,"That he hath given away!--Now, by my life,"
1532,Old fools are babes again; and must be us'd
1532,"With checks as flatteries,--when they are seen abus'd."
1532,Remember what I have said.
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Very well, madam."
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,And let his knights have colder looks among you;
1532,"What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so;"
1532,"I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,"
1532,That I may speak.--I'll write straight to my sister
1532,To hold my very course.--Prepare for dinner.

1532,"[Enter Kent, disguised.]"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"If but as well I other accents borrow,"
1532,"That can my speech defuse, my good intent"
1532,May carry through itself to that full issue
1532,"For which I rais'd my likeness.--Now, banish'd Kent,"
1532,"If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,"
1532,"So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st,"
1532,Shall find thee full of labours.
1532,
1532,"[Horns within. Enter King Lear, Knights, and Attendants.]"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.
1532,
1532,[Exit an Attendant.]
1532,
1532,How now! what art thou?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"A man, sir."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve him truly that
1532,will put me in trust; to love him that is honest; to converse
1532,with him that is wise and says little; to fear judgment; to fight
1532,when I cannot choose; and to eat no fish.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,What art thou?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king, thou art"
1532,poor enough. What wouldst thou?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Service.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Who wouldst thou serve?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,You.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Dost thou know me, fellow?"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would fain"
1532,call master.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,What's that?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Authority.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,What services canst thou do?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in"
1532,telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which
1532,"ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of"
1532,me is diligence.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,How old art thou?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing; nor so old to"
1532,dote on her for anything: I have years on my back forty-eight.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after
1532,"dinner, I will not part from thee yet.--Dinner, ho, dinner!--"
1532,Where's my knave? my fool?--Go you and call my fool hither.
1532,
1532,[Exit an attendant.]
1532,
1532,[Enter Oswald.]
1532,
1532,"You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?"
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"So please you,--"
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.--
1532,
1532,[Exit a Knight.]
1532,
1532,"Where's my fool, ho?--I think the world's asleep."
1532,
1532,[Re-enter Knight.]
1532,
1532,How now! where's that mongrel?
1532,
1532,Knight.
1532,"He says, my lord, your daughter is not well."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Why came not the slave back to me when I called him?
1532,
1532,Knight.
1532,"Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,He would not!
1532,
1532,Knight.
1532,"My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my judgment your"
1532,highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as
1532,you were wont; there's a great abatement of kindness appears as
1532,well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also and
1532,your daughter.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Ha! say'st thou so?
1532,
1532,Knight.
1532,"I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for my duty"
1532,cannot be silent when I think your highness wronged.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I have perceived
1532,a most faint neglect of late; which I have rather blamed as mine
1532,own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of
1532,unkindness: I will look further into't.--But where's my fool? I
1532,have not seen him this two days.
1532,
1532,Knight.
1532,"Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool hath much"
1532,pined away.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,No more of that; I have noted it well.--Go you and tell my
1532,daughter I would speak with her.--
1532,
1532,[Exit Attendant.]
1532,
1532,"Go you, call hither my fool."
1532,
1532,[Exit another Attendant.]
1532,
1532,[Re-enter Oswald.]
1532,
1532,"O, you, sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I, sir?"
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,My lady's father.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,My lady's father! my lord's knave: you whoreson dog! you slave!
1532,you cur!
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?"
1532,[Striking him.]
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"I'll not be struck, my lord."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player."
1532,[Tripping up his heels.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll love thee."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences: away, away!"
1532,"If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry; but away!"
1532,go to; have you wisdom? so.
1532,[Pushes Oswald out.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's earnest of thy"
1532,service.
1532,[Giving Kent money.]
1532,
1532,[Enter Fool.]
1532,
1532,Fool. Let me hire him too; here's my coxcomb.
1532,[Giving Kent his cap.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Why, fool?"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an thou"
1532,"canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly:"
1532,"there, take my coxcomb: why, this fellow hath banish'd two on's"
1532,"daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will; if"
1532,"thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.--How now,"
1532,nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Why, my boy?"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"If I gave them all my living, I'd keep my coxcombs myself."
1532,There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Take heed, sirrah,--the whip."
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped out, when"
1532,the lady brach may stand by the fire and stink.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,A pestilent gall to me!
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Do.
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Mark it, nuncle:--"
1532,"    Have more than thou showest,"
1532,"    Speak less than thou knowest,"
1532,"    Lend less than thou owest,"
1532,"    Ride more than thou goest,"
1532,"    Learn more than thou trowest,"
1532,    Set less than thou throwest;
1532,"    Leave thy drink and thy whore,"
1532,"    And keep in-a-door,"
1532,    And thou shalt have more
1532,    Than two tens to a score.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"This is nothing, fool."
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer,--you gave me"
1532,"nothing for't.--Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing."
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"[to Kent] Pr'ythee tell him, so much the rent of his land"
1532,comes to: he will not believe a fool.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,A bitter fool!
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and"
1532,a sweet one?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"No, lad; teach me."
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,   That lord that counsell'd thee
1532,"     To give away thy land,"
1532,"   Come place him here by me,--"
1532,     Do thou for him stand:
1532,   The sweet and bitter fool
1532,     Will presently appear;
1532,"   The one in motley here,"
1532,     The other found out there.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Dost thou call me fool, boy?"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born
1532,with.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"This is not altogether fool, my lord."
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"No, faith; lords and great men will not let me: if I had a"
1532,"monopoly out, they would have part on't and loads too: they"
1532,will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be
1532,"snatching.--Nuncle, give me an egg, and I'll give thee two"
1532,crowns.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,What two crowns shall they be?
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle and eat up the"
1532,"meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i'"
1532,"the middle and gav'st away both parts, thou borest thine ass on"
1532,thy back o'er the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown
1532,when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in
1532,"this, let him be whipped that first finds it so."
1532,[Singing.]
1532,   Fools had ne'er less grace in a year;
1532,"     For wise men are grown foppish,"
1532,"   And know not how their wits to wear,"
1532,     Their manners are so apish.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"I have used it, nuncle, e'er since thou mad'st thy daughters thy"
1532,"mothers; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and puttest down"
1532,"thine own breeches,"
1532,[Singing.]
1532,"   Then they for sudden joy did weep,"
1532,"     And I for sorrow sung,"
1532,   That such a king should play bo-peep
1532,     And go the fools among.
1532,
1532,"Pr'ythee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to"
1532,lie; I would fain learn to lie.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped."
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are: they'll have me
1532,whipped for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipped for lying;
1532,and sometimes I am whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be
1532,"any kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be thee,"
1532,"nuncle: thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides, and left nothing"
1532,i' the middle:--here comes one o' the parings.
1532,
1532,[Enter Goneril.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you"
1532,are too much of late i' the frown.
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for
1532,her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure: I am better
1532,"than thou art; I am a fool, thou art nothing.--Yes, forsooth, I"
1532,"will hold my tongue. So your face [To Goneril.] bids me, though"
1532,"you say nothing. Mum, mum,"
1532,"     He that keeps nor crust nor crum,"
1532,"     Weary of all, shall want some.--"
1532,[Pointing to Lear.] That's a shealed peascod.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,"
1532,But other of your insolent retinue
1532,Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
1532,"In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,"
1532,"I had thought, by making this well known unto you,"
1532,"To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,"
1532,"By what yourself too late have spoke and done,"
1532,"That you protect this course, and put it on"
1532,"By your allowance; which if you should, the fault"
1532,"Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,"
1532,"Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,"
1532,Might in their working do you that offence
1532,"Which else were shame, that then necessity"
1532,Will call discreet proceeding.
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"For you know, nuncle,"
1532,   The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long
1532,   That it had it head bit off by it young.
1532,"So out went the candle, and we were left darkling."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Are you our daughter?
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Come, sir,"
1532,"I would you would make use of that good wisdom,"
1532,Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
1532,"These dispositions, that of late transform you"
1532,From what you rightly are.
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?--Whoop, Jug! I"
1532,love thee!
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Doth any here know me?--This is not Lear;
1532,Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
1532,"Either his notion weakens, his discernings"
1532,Are lethargied.--Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!--
1532,Who is it that can tell me who I am?
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,Lear's shadow.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,"
1532,"Knowledge, and reason,"
1532,I should be false persuaded I had daughters.
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,Which they will make an obedient father.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Your name, fair gentlewoman?"
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"This admiration, sir, is much o' the favour"
1532,Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
1532,To understand my purposes aright:
1532,"As you are old and reverend, you should be wise."
1532,Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
1532,"Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold"
1532,"That this our court, infected with their manners,"
1532,Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
1532,Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
1532,Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak
1532,"For instant remedy: be, then, desir'd"
1532,By her that else will take the thing she begs
1532,A little to disquantity your train;
1532,"And the remainder, that shall still depend,"
1532,"To be such men as may besort your age,"
1532,"Which know themselves, and you."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Darkness and devils!--
1532,Saddle my horses; call my train together.--
1532,Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee:
1532,Yet have I left a daughter.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
1532,Make servants of their betters.
1532,
1532,[Enter Albany.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Woe that too late repents!--
1532,"[To Albany.] O, sir, are you come?"
1532,"Is it your will? Speak, sir.--Prepare my horses.--"
1532,"Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,"
1532,More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
1532,Than the sea-monster!
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Pray, sir, be patient."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"[to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest!:"
1532,"My train are men of choice and rarest parts,"
1532,That all particulars of duty know;
1532,And in the most exact regard support
1532,"The worships of their name.--O most small fault,"
1532,How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
1532,"Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature"
1532,"From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love,"
1532,"And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!"
1532,Beat at this gate that let thy folly in  [Striking his head.]
1532,"And thy dear judgment out!--Go, go, my people."
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant"
1532,Of what hath mov'd you.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"It may be so, my lord."
1532,"Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear"
1532,"Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend"
1532,To make this creature fruitful!
1532,Into her womb convey sterility!
1532,Dry up in her the organs of increase;
1532,And from her derogate body never spring
1532,"A babe to honour her! If she must teem,"
1532,"Create her child of spleen, that it may live"
1532,And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her!
1532,Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
1532,With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
1532,Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
1532,To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
1532,How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
1532,"To have a thankless child!--Away, away!"
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?"
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,Never afflict yourself to know more of it;
1532,But let his disposition have that scope
1532,That dotage gives it.
1532,
1532,[Re-enter Lear.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"What, fifty of my followers at a clap!"
1532,Within a fortnight!
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"What's the matter, sir?"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,I'll tell thee.--Life and death!--[To Goneril] I am asham'd
1532,That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
1532,"That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,"
1532,Should make thee worth them.--Blasts and fogs upon thee!
1532,Th' untented woundings of a father's curse
1532,"Pierce every sense about thee!--Old fond eyes,"
1532,"Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck you out,"
1532,"And cast you, with the waters that you lose,"
1532,To temper clay. Ha!
1532,"Let it be so: I have another daughter,"
1532,"Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:"
1532,"When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails"
1532,She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
1532,That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
1532,I have cast off for ever.
1532,
1532,"[Exeunt Lear, Kent, and Attendants.]"
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,Do you mark that?
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"I cannot be so partial, Goneril,"
1532,"To the great love I bear you,--"
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Pray you, content.--What, Oswald, ho!"
1532,"[To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master."
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry,--take the fool with thee.--"
1532,"   A fox when one has caught her,"
1532,"   And such a daughter,"
1532,"   Should sure to the slaughter,"
1532,   If my cap would buy a halter;
1532,   So the fool follows after.
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,This man hath had good counsel.--A hundred knights!
1532,'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
1532,"At point a hundred knights: yes, that on every dream,"
1532,"Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,"
1532,"He may enguard his dotage with their powers,"
1532,"And hold our lives in mercy.--Oswald, I say!--"
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Well, you may fear too far."
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,Safer than trust too far:
1532,"Let me still take away the harms I fear,"
1532,Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
1532,What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister:
1532,"If she sustain him and his hundred knights,"
1532,"When I have show'd th' unfitness,--"
1532,
1532,[Re-enter Oswald.]
1532,
1532,"How now, Oswald!"
1532,"What, have you writ that letter to my sister?"
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Ay, madam."
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Take you some company, and away to horse:"
1532,Inform her full of my particular fear;
1532,And thereto add such reasons of your own
1532,As may compact it more. Get you gone;
1532,And hasten your return.
1532,
1532,[Exit Oswald.]
1532,
1532,"No, no, my lord!"
1532,"This milky gentleness and course of yours,"
1532,"Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon,"
1532,You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
1532,Than prais'd for harmful mildness.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell:
1532,"Striving to better, oft we mar what's well."
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Nay then,--"
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Well, well; the event."

1532,
1532,"[Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.]"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Go you before to Gloster with these letters: acquaint my
1532,daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her
1532,"demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I"
1532,shall be there afore you.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter."
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in danger of kibes?"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Ay, boy."
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,Then I pr'ythee be merry; thy wit shall not go slipshod.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Ha, ha, ha!"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for though
1532,"she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tell"
1532,what I can tell.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"What canst tell, boy?"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,She'll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou
1532,canst tell why one's nose stands i' the middle on's face?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,No.
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what a man"
1532,"cannot smell out, he may spy into."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"I did her wrong,--"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,No.
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Why?
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his daughters, and"
1532,leave his horns without a case.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,I will forget my nature. So kind a father!--Be my horses ready?
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven stars are
1532,no more than seven is a pretty reason.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Because they are not eight?
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,Yes indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,To tak't again perforce!--Monster ingratitude!
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten for being"
1532,old before thy time.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,How's that?
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!"
1532,Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!--
1532,
1532,[Enter Gentleman.]
1532,

1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Save thee, Curan."
1532,
1532,Cur.
1532,"And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him"
1532,notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchess will be
1532,here with him this night.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,How comes that?
1532,
1532,Cur.
1532,"Nay, I know not.--You have heard of the news abroad; I mean the"
1532,"whispered ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Not I: pray you, what are they?"
1532,
1532,Cur.
1532,"Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the two dukes"
1532,of Cornwall and Albany?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Not a word.
1532,
1532,Cur.
1532,"You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir."
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!
1532,This weaves itself perforce into my business.
1532,My father hath set guard to take my brother;
1532,"And I have one thing, of a queasy question,"
1532,Which I must act:--briefness and fortune work!--
1532,"Brother, a word!--descend:--brother, I say!"
1532,
1532,[Enter Edgar.]
1532,
1532,"My father watches:--sir, fly this place;"
1532,Intelligence is given where you are hid;
1532,You have now the good advantage of the night.--
1532,Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
1532,"He's coming hither; now, i' the night, i' the haste,"
1532,And Regan with him: have you nothing said
1532,Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
1532,Advise yourself.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"I am sure on't, not a word."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,I hear my father coming:--pardon me;
1532,In cunning I must draw my sword upon you:--
1532,Draw: seem to defend yourself: now quit you well.--
1532,"Yield:--come before my father.--Light, ho, here!"
1532,"Fly, brother.--Torches, torches!--So farewell."
1532,
1532,[Exit Edgar.]
1532,
1532,Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
1532,Of my more fierce endeavour: [Wounds his arm.]
1532,I have seen drunkards
1532,"Do more than this in sport.--Father, father!"
1532,"Stop, stop! No help?"
1532,
1532,"[Enter Gloster, and Servants with torches.]"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Now, Edmund, where's the villain?"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,"
1532,"Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon"
1532,"To stand auspicious mistress,--"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,But where is he?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Look, sir, I bleed."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Where is the villain, Edmund?"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could,--"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Pursue him, ho!--Go after."
1532,
1532,[Exeunt Servants.]
1532,
1532,--By no means what?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
1532,But that I told him the revenging gods
1532,'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
1532,Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
1532,"The child was bound to the father;--sir, in fine,"
1532,Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
1532,"To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion"
1532,"With his prepared sword, he charges home"
1532,"My unprovided body, lanc'd mine arm;"
1532,"But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,"
1532,"Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to the encounter,"
1532,"Or whether gasted by the noise I made,"
1532,Full suddenly he fled.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Let him fly far;
1532,Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
1532,"And found--dispatch'd.--The noble duke my master,"
1532,"My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:"
1532,"By his authority I will proclaim it,"
1532,"That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,"
1532,Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
1532,"He that conceals him, death."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"When I dissuaded him from his intent,"
1532,"And found him pight to do it, with curst speech"
1532,"I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,"
1532,"'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,"
1532,"If I would stand against thee, would the reposal"
1532,"Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee"
1532,Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny
1532,"As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce"
1532,"My very character, I'd turn it all"
1532,"To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice:"
1532,"And thou must make a dullard of the world,"
1532,If they not thought the profits of my death
1532,Were very pregnant and potential spurs
1532,To make thee seek it.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Strong and fast'ned villain!
1532,Would he deny his letter?--I never got him.
1532,
1532,[Trumpets within.]
1532,
1532,"Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.--"
1532,All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;
1532,"The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture"
1532,"I will send far and near, that all the kingdom"
1532,"May have due note of him; and of my land,"
1532,"Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means"
1532,To make thee capable.
1532,
1532,"[Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.]"
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,--"
1532,"Which I can call but now,--I have heard strange news."
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"If it be true, all vengeance comes too short"
1532,"Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"O madam, my old heart is crack'd,--it's crack'd!"
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"What, did my father's godson seek your life?"
1532,He whom my father nam'd? your Edgar?
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!"
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,Was he not companion with the riotous knights
1532,That tend upon my father?
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"I know not, madam:--"
1532,"It is too bad, too bad."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Yes, madam, he was of that consort."
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,No marvel then though he were ill affected:
1532,"'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,"
1532,To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
1532,I have this present evening from my sister
1532,Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions
1532,"That if they come to sojourn at my house,"
1532,I'll not be there.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"Nor I, assure thee, Regan.--"
1532,"Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father"
1532,A childlike office.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"'Twas my duty, sir."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,He did bewray his practice; and receiv'd
1532,"This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him."
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,Is he pursu'd?
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Ay, my good lord."
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"If he be taken, he shall never more"
1532,"Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,"
1532,"How in my strength you please.--For you, Edmund,"
1532,Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
1532,"So much commend itself, you shall be ours:"
1532,Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
1532,You we first seize on.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"I shall serve you, sir,"
1532,"Truly, however else."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,For him I thank your grace.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"You know not why we came to visit you,--"
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night:"
1532,"Occasions, noble Gloster, of some poise,"
1532,Wherein we must have use of your advice:--
1532,"Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,"
1532,"Of differences, which I best thought it fit"
1532,To answer from our home; the several messengers
1532,"From hence attend despatch. Our good old friend,"
1532,Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
1532,"Your needful counsel to our business,"
1532,Which craves the instant use.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"I serve you, madam:"
1532,Your graces are right welcome.

1532,
1532,"[Enter Kent and Oswald, severally.]"
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Ay.
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,Where may we set our horses?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,I' the mire.
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Pr'ythee, if thou lov'st me, tell me."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,I love thee not.
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Why then, I care not for thee."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee care for me."
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Fellow, I know thee."
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,What dost thou know me for?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud,"
1532,"shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,"
1532,"worsted-stocking knave; a lily-livered, action-taking, whoreson,"
1532,"glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue;"
1532,one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of
1532,"good service, and art nothing but the composition of a"
1532,"knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel"
1532,"bitch: one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou"
1532,denyest the least syllable of thy addition.
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that's"
1532,neither known of thee nor knows thee?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! Is"
1532,it two days ago since I beat thee and tripped up thy heels before
1532,"the king? Draw, you rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon"
1532,"shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you: draw, you"
1532,"whoreson cullionly barbermonger, draw!"
1532,
1532,[Drawing his sword.]
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the king; and"
1532,take vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her father:
1532,"draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado your shanks:--"
1532,"draw, you rascal; come your ways!"
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Help, ho! murder! help!"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat slave, strike!"
1532,
1532,[Beating him.]
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Help, ho! murder! murder!"
1532,
1532,"[Enter Edmund, Cornwall, Regan, Gloster, and Servants.]"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,How now! What's the matter?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll flesh you; come"
1532,"on, young master."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Weapons! arms! What's the matter here?
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"Keep peace, upon your lives;"
1532,He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,The messengers from our sister and the king.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,What is your difference? speak.
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"I am scarce in breath, my lord."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You cowardly"
1532,"rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee."
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Ay, a tailor, sir: a stonecutter or a painter could not have"
1532,"made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the trade."
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?"
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared at suit of"
1532,his grey
1532,"beard,--"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter!--My lord, if you'll"
1532,"give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and"
1532,"daub the walls of a jakes with him.--Spare my grey beard, you"
1532,wagtail?
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"Peace, sirrah!"
1532,"You beastly knave, know you no reverence?"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege."
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,Why art thou angry?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"That such a slave as this should wear a sword,"
1532,"Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,"
1532,"Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain"
1532,Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
1532,That in the natures of their lords rebel;
1532,"Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;"
1532,"Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks"
1532,"With every gale and vary of their masters,"
1532,"Knowing naught, like dogs, but following.--"
1532,A plague upon your epileptic visage!
1532,"Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?"
1532,"Goose, an I had you upon Sarum plain,"
1532,I'd drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"What, art thou mad, old fellow?"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,How fell you out?
1532,Say that.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,No contraries hold more antipathy
1532,Than I and such a knave.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,His countenance likes me not.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:"
1532,I have seen better faces in my time
1532,Than stands on any shoulder that I see
1532,Before me at this instant.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,This is some fellow
1532,"Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect"
1532,"A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb"
1532,"Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,--"
1532,"An honest mind and plain,--he must speak truth!"
1532,"An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain."
1532,These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness
1532,Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
1532,Than twenty silly-ducking observants
1532,That stretch their duties nicely.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,"
1532,"Under the allowance of your great aspect,"
1532,"Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire"
1532,"On flickering Phoebus' front,--"
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,What mean'st by this?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I know,"
1532,"sir, I am no flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain accent"
1532,"was a plain knave; which, for my part, I will not be, though I"
1532,should win your displeasure to entreat me to't.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,What was the offence you gave him?
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,I never gave him any:
1532,It pleas'd the king his master very late
1532,"To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;"
1532,"When he, compact, and flattering his displeasure,"
1532,"Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd"
1532,"And put upon him such a deal of man,"
1532,"That worthied him, got praises of the king"
1532,For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;
1532,"And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,"
1532,Drew on me here again.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,None of these rogues and cowards
1532,But Ajax is their fool.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,Fetch forth the stocks!--
1532,"You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,"
1532,"We'll teach you,--"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Sir, I am too old to learn:"
1532,Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
1532,On whose employment I was sent to you:
1532,"You shall do small respect, show too bold malice"
1532,"Against the grace and person of my master,"
1532,Stocking his messenger.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"Fetch forth the stocks!--As I have life and honour,"
1532,there shall he sit till noon.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"Till noon! Till night, my lord; and all night too!"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,"
1532,You should not use me so.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"Sir, being his knave, I will."
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,This is a fellow of the self-same colour
1532,"Our sister speaks of.--Come, bring away the stocks!"
1532,
1532,[Stocks brought out.]
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
1532,"His fault is much, and the good king his master"
1532,Will check him for't: your purpos'd low correction
1532,Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
1532,"For pilferings and most common trespasses,"
1532,Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill
1532,"That he, so slightly valu'd in his messenger,"
1532,Should have him thus restrain'd.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,I'll answer that.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"My sister may receive it much more worse,"
1532,"To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted,"
1532,For following her affairs.--Put in his legs.--
1532,
1532,[Kent is put in the stocks.]
1532,
1532,"Come, my good lord, away."
1532,
1532,[Exeunt all but Gloster and Kent.]
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,"
1532,"Whose disposition, all the world well knows,"
1532,Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd; I'll entreat for thee.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Pray do not, sir: I have watch'd, and travell'd hard;"
1532,"Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle."
1532,A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
1532,Give you good morrow!
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,The duke's to blame in this: 'twill be ill taken.
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Good king, that must approve the common saw,--"
1532,Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st
1532,To the warm sun!
1532,"Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,"
1532,That by thy comfortable beams I may
1532,Peruse this letter.--Nothing almost sees miracles
1532,"But misery:--I know 'tis from Cordelia,"
1532,Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
1532,Of my obscured course; and shall find time
1532,"From this enormous state,--seeking to give"
1532,"Losses their remedies,--All weary and o'erwatch'd,"
1532,"Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold"
1532,This shameful lodging.

1532,I heard myself proclaim'd;
1532,And by the happy hollow of a tree
1532,Escap'd the hunt. No port is free; no place
1532,That guard and most unusual vigilance
1532,"Does not attend my taking. While I may scape,"
1532,I will preserve myself: and am bethought
1532,To take the basest and most poorest shape
1532,"That ever penury, in contempt of man,"
1532,Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
1532,Blanket my loins; elf all my hair in knots;
1532,And with presented nakedness outface
1532,The winds and persecutions of the sky.
1532,The country gives me proof and precedent
1532,"Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,"
1532,Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
1532,"Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;"
1532,"And with this horrible object, from low farms,"
1532,"Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,"
1532,"Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,"
1532,Enforce their charity.--Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!

1532,"Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the"
1532,"head; dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and"
1532,"men by the legs: when a man is over-lusty at legs, then he"
1532,wears wooden nether-stocks.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
1532,To set thee here?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"It is both he and she,"
1532,Your son and daughter.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,No.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Yes.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"No, I say."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"I say, yea."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"No, no; they would not."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Yes, they have."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"By Jupiter, I swear no."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"By Juno, I swear ay."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,They durst not do't.
1532,"They would not, could not do't; 'tis worse than murder,"
1532,To do upon respect such violent outrage:
1532,"Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way"
1532,"Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,"
1532,Coming from us.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"My lord, when at their home"
1532,"I did commend your highness' letters to them,"
1532,Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
1532,"My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,"
1532,"Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth"
1532,From Goneril his mistress salutations;
1532,"Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,"
1532,"Which presently they read: on whose contents,"
1532,"They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;"
1532,Commanded me to follow and attend
1532,The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
1532,"And meeting here the other messenger,"
1532,"Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine,--"
1532,Being the very fellow which of late
1532,"Display'd so saucily against your highness,--"
1532,"Having more man than wit about me, drew:"
1532,He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.
1532,Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
1532,The shame which here it suffers.
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way."
1532,  Fathers that wear rags
1532,    Do make their children blind;
1532,  But fathers that bear bags
1532,    Shall see their children kind.
1532,"  Fortune, that arrant whore,"
1532,  Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.
1532,"But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy"
1532,daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!"
1532,"Hysterica passio,--down, thou climbing sorrow,"
1532,Thy element's below!--Where is this daughter?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"With the earl, sir, here within."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Follow me not;
1532,Stay here.
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,None.
1532,How chance the king comes with so small a number?
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"An thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that question,"
1532,thou hadst well deserved it.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Why, fool?"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's no"
1532,labouring in the winter. All that follow their noses are led by
1532,their eyes but blind men; and there's not a nose among twenty
1532,but can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great
1532,"wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following"
1532,"it; but the great one that goes up the hill, let him draw thee"
1532,after.
1532,"When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I"
1532,"would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it."
1532,"   That sir which serves and seeks for gain,"
1532,"     And follows but for form,"
1532,"   Will pack when it begins to rain,"
1532,     And leave thee in the storm.
1532,"   But I will tarry; the fool will stay,"
1532,     And let the wise man fly:
1532,   The knave turns fool that runs away;
1532,"     The fool no knave, perdy."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Where learn'd you this, fool?"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Not i' the stocks, fool."
1532,
1532,"[Re-enter Lear, with Gloster.]"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
1532,They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;
1532,The images of revolt and flying off.
1532,Fetch me a better answer.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"My dear lord,"
1532,You know the fiery quality of the duke;
1532,How unremovable and fix'd he is
1532,In his own course.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!--
1532,"Fiery? What quality? why, Gloster, Gloster,"
1532,I'd speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Ay, my good lord."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
1532,"Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:"
1532,Are they inform'd of this?--My breath and blood!--
1532,Fiery? the fiery duke?--Tell the hot duke that--
1532,"No, but not yet: may be he is not well:"
1532,Infirmity doth still neglect all office
1532,Whereto our health is bound: we are not ourselves
1532,"When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind"
1532,To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
1532,"And am fallen out with my more headier will,"
1532,To take the indispos'd and sickly fit
1532,For the sound man.--Death on my state! Wherefore
1532,[Looking on Kent.]
1532,Should he sit here? This act persuades me
1532,That this remotion of the duke and her
1532,Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
1532,"Go tell the duke and's wife I'd speak with them,"
1532,"Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,"
1532,Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
1532,Till it cry 'Sleep to death.'
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,I would have all well betwixt you.
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"O me, my heart, my rising heart!--but down!"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she"
1532,put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em o' the coxcombs with
1532,"a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that,"
1532,"in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay."
1532,
1532,"[Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloster, and Servants.]"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Good-morrow to you both.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,Hail to your grace!
1532,
1532,[Kent is set at liberty.]
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,I am glad to see your highness.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Regan, I think you are; I know what reason"
1532,"I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,"
1532,"I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,"
1532,"Sepulchring an adultress.--[To Kent] O, are you free?"
1532,"Some other time for that.--Beloved Regan,"
1532,"Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied"
1532,"Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here,--"
1532,[Points to his heart.]
1532,I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
1532,With how deprav'd a quality--O Regan!
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope"
1532,You less know how to value her desert
1532,Than she to scant her duty.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Say, how is that?"
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,I cannot think my sister in the least
1532,"Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance"
1532,"She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,"
1532,"'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,"
1532,As clears her from all blame.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,My curses on her!
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"O, sir, you are old;"
1532,Nature in you stands on the very verge
1532,Of her confine: you should be rul'd and led
1532,"By some discretion, that discerns your state"
1532,"Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,"
1532,That to our sister you do make return;
1532,"Say you have wrong'd her, sir."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Ask her forgiveness?
1532,Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
1532,"'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;"
1532,[Kneeling.]
1532,Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
1532,"That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'"
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks:"
1532,Return you to my sister.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"[Rising.] Never, Regan:"
1532,She hath abated me of half my train;
1532,"Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,"
1532,"Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:--"
1532,All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall
1532,"On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,"
1532,"You taking airs, with lameness!"
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"Fie, sir, fie!"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames"
1532,"Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,"
1532,"You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,"
1532,To fall and blast her pride!
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,O the blest gods!
1532,So will you wish on me when the rash mood is on.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:"
1532,Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
1532,Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
1532,"Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee"
1532,"To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,"
1532,"To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,"
1532,"And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt"
1532,Against my coming in: thou better know'st
1532,"The offices of nature, bond of childhood,"
1532,"Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;"
1532,"Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,"
1532,Wherein I thee endow'd.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"Good sir, to the purpose."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Who put my man i' the stocks?
1532,
1532,[Tucket within.]
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,What trumpet's that?
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"I know't--my sister's: this approves her letter,"
1532,That she would soon be here.
1532,
1532,[Enter Oswald.]
1532,
1532,Is your lady come?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride"
1532,Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.--
1532,"Out, varlet, from my sight!"
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,What means your grace?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope"
1532,Thou didst not know on't.--Who comes here? O heavens!
1532,
1532,[Enter Goneril.]
1532,
1532,"If you do love old men, if your sweet sway"
1532,"Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,"
1532,"Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!--"
1532,[To Goneril.] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?--
1532,"O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?"
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?"
1532,All's not offence that indiscretion finds
1532,And dotage terms so.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"O sides, you are too tough!"
1532,Will you yet hold?--How came my man i' the stocks?
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"I set him there, sir: but his own disorders"
1532,Deserv'd much less advancement.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,You? did you?
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"I pray you, father, being weak, seem so."
1532,"If, till the expiration of your month,"
1532,"You will return and sojourn with my sister,"
1532,"Dismissing half your train, come then to me:"
1532,"I am now from home, and out of that provision"
1532,Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?"
1532,"No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose"
1532,To wage against the enmity o' the air;
1532,"To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--"
1532,Necessity's sharp pinch!--Return with her?
1532,"Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took"
1532,"Our youngest born, I could as well be brought"
1532,"To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg"
1532,To keep base life afoot.--Return with her?
1532,Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
1532,To this detested groom.
1532,[Pointing to Oswald.]
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"At your choice, sir."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"I pr'ythee, daughter, do not make me mad:"
1532,"I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:"
1532,"We'll no more meet, no more see one another:--"
1532,"But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;"
1532,"Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,"
1532,"Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,"
1532,"A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle"
1532,In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
1532,"Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:"
1532,I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot
1532,Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
1532,Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
1532,"I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,"
1532,I and my hundred knights.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,Not altogether so:
1532,"I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided"
1532,"For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;"
1532,For those that mingle reason with your passion
1532,"Must be content to think you old, and so--"
1532,But she knows what she does.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Is this well spoken?
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?"
1532,Is it not well? What should you need of more?
1532,"Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger"
1532,Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house
1532,"Should many people, under two commands,"
1532,Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance"
1532,"From those that she calls servants, or from mine?"
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack you,"
1532,"We could control them. If you will come to me,--"
1532,"For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you"
1532,To bring but five-and-twenty: to no more
1532,Will I give place or notice.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"I gave you all,--"
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,And in good time you gave it.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Made you my guardians, my depositaries;"
1532,But kept a reservation to be follow'd
1532,"With such a number. What, must I come to you"
1532,"With five-and-twenty, Regan? said you so?"
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,And speak't again my lord; no more with me.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd
1532,When others are more wicked; not being the worst
1532,Stands in some rank of praise.--
1532,[To Goneril.] I'll go with thee:
1532,"Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,"
1532,And thou art twice her love.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Hear, me, my lord:"
1532,"What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,"
1532,To follow in a house where twice so many
1532,Have a command to tend you?
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,What need one?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"O, reason not the need: our basest beggars"
1532,Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
1532,"Allow not nature more than nature needs,"
1532,Man's life is cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
1532,"If only to go warm were gorgeous,"
1532,"Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st"
1532,"Which scarcely keeps thee warm.--But, for true need,--"
1532,"You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!"
1532,"You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,"
1532,As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
1532,If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
1532,"Against their father, fool me not so much"
1532,"To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,"
1532,"And let not women's weapons, water-drops,"
1532,"Stain my man's cheeks!--No, you unnatural hags,"
1532,I will have such revenges on you both
1532,"That all the world shall,--I will do such things,--"
1532,"What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be"
1532,The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep;
1532,"No, I'll not weep:--"
1532,I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
1532,Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
1532,"Or ere I'll weep.--O fool, I shall go mad!"
1532,
1532,"[Exeunt Lear, Gloster, Kent, and Fool. Storm heard at a"
1532,distance.]
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,This house is little: the old man and his people
1532,Cannot be well bestow'd.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest
1532,And must needs taste his folly.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,"
1532,But not one follower.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,So am I purpos'd.
1532,Where is my lord of Gloster?
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,Followed the old man forth:--he is return'd.
1532,
1532,[Re-enter Gloster.]
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,The king is in high rage.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,Whither is he going?
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"My lord, entreat him by no means to stay."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Alack, the night comes on, and the high winds"
1532,Do sorely ruffle; for many miles about
1532,There's scarce a bush.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"O, sir, to wilful men"
1532,The injuries that they themselves procure
1532,Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
1532,He is attended with a desperate train;
1532,"And what they may incense him to, being apt"
1532,"To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear."
1532,
1532,Corn.
1532,"Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:"
1532,My Regan counsels well: come out o' the storm.

1532,I know you. Where's the king?
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,Contending with the fretful elements;
1532,"Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,"
1532,"Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,"
1532,"That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,"
1532,"Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,"
1532,Catch in their fury and make nothing of;
1532,Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
1532,The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
1532,"This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,"
1532,The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
1532,"Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,"
1532,And bids what will take all.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,But who is with him?
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"None but the fool, who labours to out-jest"
1532,His heart-struck injuries.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Sir, I do know you;"
1532,"And dare, upon the warrant of my note,"
1532,"Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,"
1532,Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
1532,"With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;"
1532,"Who have,--as who have not, that their great stars"
1532,"Throne and set high?--servants, who seem no less,"
1532,Which are to France the spies and speculations
1532,"Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,"
1532,Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes;
1532,Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
1532,"Against the old kind king; or something deeper,"
1532,"Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings;--"
1532,"But, true it is, from France there comes a power"
1532,"Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,"
1532,"Wise in our negligence, have secret feet"
1532,"In some of our best ports, and are at point"
1532,To show their open banner.--Now to you:
1532,If on my credit you dare build so far
1532,"To make your speed to Dover, you shall find"
1532,Some that will thank you making just report
1532,Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
1532,The king hath cause to plain.
1532,I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
1532,And from some knowledge and assurance offer
1532,This office to you.
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,I will talk further with you.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"No, do not."
1532,For confirmation that I am much more
1532,"Than my out wall, open this purse, and take"
1532,"What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--"
1532,"As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;"
1532,And she will tell you who your fellow is
1532,That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
1532,I will go seek the king.
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,Give me your hand: have you no more to say?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet,--"
1532,"That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain"
1532,"That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him"
1532,Holla the other.
1532,
1532,[Exeunt severally.]

1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!"
1532,"You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout"
1532,"Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!"
1532,"You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,"
1532,"Vaunt couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,"
1532,"Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,"
1532,Strike flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
1532,"Crack nature's moulds, all germens spill at once,"
1532,That make ingrateful man!
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this"
1532,"rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in; and ask thy daughters"
1532,blessing: here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!"
1532,"Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters:"
1532,"I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;"
1532,"I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children;"
1532,You owe me no subscription: then let fall
1532,"Your horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave,"
1532,"A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man:--"
1532,"But yet I call you servile ministers,"
1532,That will with two pernicious daughters join
1532,Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head
1532,So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,He that has a house to put 's head in has a good head-piece.
1532,   The codpiece that will house
1532,"     Before the head has any,"
1532,   The head and he shall louse:
1532,     So beggars marry many.
1532,   The man that makes his toe
1532,     What he his heart should make
1532,"   Shall of a corn cry woe,"
1532,     And turn his sleep to wake.
1532,--for there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a
1532,glass.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"No, I will be the pattern of all patience;"
1532,I will say nothing.
1532,
1532,[Enter Kent.]
1532,
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Who's there?
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and a fool."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night"
1532,Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
1532,"Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,"
1532,"And make them keep their caves; since I was man,"
1532,"Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,"
1532,Such groans of roaring wind and rain I never
1532,Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry
1532,Th' affliction nor the fear.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Let the great gods,"
1532,"That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,"
1532,"Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,"
1532,That hast within thee undivulged crimes
1532,"Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;"
1532,"Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue"
1532,"That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake"
1532,That under covert and convenient seeming
1532,"Hast practis'd on man's life: close pent-up guilts,"
1532,"Rive your concealing continents, and cry"
1532,These dreadful summoners grace.--I am a man
1532,More sinn'd against than sinning.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Alack, bareheaded!"
1532,"Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;"
1532,Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:
1532,"Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house,--"
1532,More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd;
1532,"Which even but now, demanding after you,"
1532,"Denied me to come in,--return, and force"
1532,Their scanted courtesy.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,My wits begin to turn.--
1532,"Come on, my boy. how dost, my boy? art cold?"
1532,"I am cold myself.--Where is this straw, my fellow?"
1532,"The art of our necessities is strange,"
1532,"That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.--"
1532,"Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart"
1532,That's sorry yet for thee.
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,[Singing.]
1532,   He that has and a little tiny wit--
1532,"     With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,--"
1532,"   Must make content with his fortunes fit,"
1532,     For the rain it raineth every day.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"True, boy.--Come, bring us to this hovel."
1532,
1532,[Exeunt Lear and Kent.]
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.--
1532,I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:--
1532,   When priests are more in word than matter;
1532,   When brewers mar their malt with water;
1532,   When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
1532,"   No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;"
1532,   When every case in law is right;
1532,   No squire in debt nor no poor knight;
1532,   When slanders do not live in tongues;
1532,   Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
1532,   When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
1532,   And bawds and whores do churches build;--
1532,   Then shall the realm of Albion
1532,   Come to great confusion:
1532,"   Then comes the time, who lives to see't,"
1532,   That going shall be us'd with feet.
1532,This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

1532,
1532,[Enter Gloster and Edmund.]
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing. When I"
1532,"desired their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the"
1532,"use of mine own house; charged me on pain of perpetual displeasure,"
1532,"neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor any way sustain him."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Most savage and unnatural!
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the dukes,"
1532,and a worse matter than that: I have received a letter this
1532,night;--'tis dangerous to be spoken;--I have locked the letter in
1532,my closet: these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
1532,home; there's part of a power already footed: we must incline to
1532,"the king. I will seek him, and privily relieve him: go you and"
1532,"maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him"
1532,"perceived: if he ask for me, I am ill, and gone to bed. If I"
1532,"die for it, as no less is threatened me, the king my old master"
1532,"must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward, Edmund;"
1532,pray you be careful.
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke"
1532,Instantly know; and of that letter too:--
1532,"This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me"
1532,"That which my father loses,--no less than all:"
1532,The younger rises when the old doth fall.

1532,
1532,"[Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.]"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:"
1532,The tyranny of the open night's too rough
1532,For nature to endure.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Let me alone.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Good my lord, enter here."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Wilt break my heart?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
1532,Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee
1532,"But where the greater malady is fix'd,"
1532,The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;
1532,"But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,"
1532,"Thou'dst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the mind's free,"
1532,The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
1532,Doth from my senses take all feeling else
1532,Save what beats there.--Filial ingratitude!
1532,Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
1532,For lifting food to't?--But I will punish home:--
1532,"No, I will weep no more.--In such a night"
1532,To shut me out!--Pour on; I will endure:--
1532,"In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!--"
1532,"Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--"
1532,"O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;"
1532,No more of that.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Good my lord, enter here."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Pr'ythee go in thyself; seek thine own ease:
1532,This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
1532,On things would hurt me more.--But I'll go in.--
1532,"[To the Fool.] In, boy; go first.--You houseless poverty,--"
1532,"Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.--"
1532,
1532,[Fool goes in.]
1532,
1532,"Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,"
1532,"That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,"
1532,"How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,"
1532,"Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you"
1532,"From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en"
1532,"Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;"
1532,"Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,"
1532,That thou mayst shake the superflux to them
1532,And show the heavens more just.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"[Within.] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!"

1532,"Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit."
1532,"Help me, help me!"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Give me thy hand.--Who's there?
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
1532,Come forth.
1532,
1532,"[Enter Edgar, disguised as a madman.]"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Away! the foul fiend follows me!--
1532,Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.--
1532,"Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Didst thou give all to thy two daughters?
1532,And art thou come to this?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath led
1532,"through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er"
1532,bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and
1532,"halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge; made him proud"
1532,"of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inched"
1532,"bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor.--Bless thy five"
1532,"wits!--Tom's a-cold.--O, do de, do de, do de.--Bless thee from"
1532,"whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some charity,"
1532,"whom the foul fiend vexes:--there could I have him now,--and"
1532,"there,--and there again, and there."
1532,[Storm continues.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?--"
1532,Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all shamed."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
1532,Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"He hath no daughters, sir."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature"
1532,To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.--
1532,Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
1532,Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
1532,Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
1532,Those pelican daughters.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:--
1532,"Halloo, halloo, loo loo!"
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Take heed o' th' foul fiend: obey thy parents; keep thy word
1532,justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set not
1532,thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom's a-cold.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,What hast thou been?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled my hair;"
1532,"wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of my mistress' heart, and"
1532,did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I spake
1532,"words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that"
1532,"slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it: wine loved"
1532,"I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk;"
1532,"false of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox"
1532,"in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey."
1532,Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray
1532,"thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot out of brothel, thy hand"
1532,"out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the foul"
1532,fiend.--Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind: says
1532,"suum, mun, nonny. Dolphin my boy, boy, sessa! let him trot by."
1532,
1532,[Storm still continues.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy"
1532,uncovered body this extremity of the skies.--Is man no more than
1532,"this? Consider him well. Thou owest the worm no silk, the beast"
1532,"no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume.--Ha! here's three"
1532,on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:
1532,"unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked"
1532,"animal as thou art.--Off, off, you lendings!--Come, unbutton"
1532,here.
1532,[Tears off his clothes.]
1532,
1532,Fool.
1532,"Pr'ythee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night to swim"
1532,in.--Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's
1532,"heart,--a small spark, all the rest on's body cold.--Look, here"
1532,comes a walking fire.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins at curfew,"
1532,"and walks till the first cock; he gives the web and the pin,"
1532,"squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white wheat,"
1532,and hurts the poor creature of earth.
1532,   Swithold footed thrice the old;
1532,"   He met the nightmare, and her nine-fold;"
1532,     Bid her alight
1532,"     And her troth plight,"
1532,"   And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,How fares your grace?
1532,
1532,[Enter Gloster with a torch.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,What's he?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Who's there? What is't you seek?
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,What are you there? Your names?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the todpole, the"
1532,"wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart, when the"
1532,"foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat"
1532,and the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the standing pool;
1532,"who is whipped from tithing to tithing, and stocked, punished,"
1532,"and imprisoned; who hath had three suits to his back, six shirts"
1532,"to his body, horse to ride, and weapons to wear;--"
1532,"   But mice and rats, and such small deer,"
1532,   Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
1532,"Beware my follower.--Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"What, hath your grace no better company?"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
1532,"Modo he's call'd, and Mahu."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Our flesh and blood, my lord, is grown so vile"
1532,That it doth hate what gets it.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Poor Tom's a-cold.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
1532,To obey in all your daughters' hard commands;
1532,"Though their injunction be to bar my doors,"
1532,"And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,"
1532,Yet have I ventur'd to come seek you out
1532,And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,First let me talk with this philosopher.--
1532,What is the cause of thunder?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.--
1532,What is your study?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Let me ask you one word in private.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Importune him once more to go, my lord;"
1532,His wits begin to unsettle.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Canst thou blame him?
1532,"His daughters seek his death:--ah, that good Kent!--"
1532,"He said it would be thus,--poor banish'd man!--"

1532,"But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,"
1532,Life would not yield to age.
1532,
1532,Old Man.
1532,"O my good lord,"
1532,"I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,"
1532,These fourscore years.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:"
1532,Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
1532,Thee they may hurt.
1532,
1532,Old Man.
1532,You cannot see your way.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;"
1532,I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen
1532,"Our means secure us, and our mere defects"
1532,"Prove our commodities.--O dear son Edgar,"
1532,The food of thy abused father's wrath!
1532,"Might I but live to see thee in my touch,"
1532,I'd say I had eyes again!
1532,
1532,Old Man.
1532,How now! Who's there?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,[Aside.] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'?
1532,I am worse than e'er I was.
1532,
1532,Old Man.
1532,'Tis poor mad Tom.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,[Aside.] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not
1532,So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'
1532,
1532,Old Man.
1532,"Fellow, where goest?"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Is it a beggar-man?
1532,
1532,Old Man.
1532,Madman and beggar too.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"He has some reason, else he could not beg."
1532,I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;
1532,Which made me think a man a worm: my son
1532,"Came then into my mind, and yet my mind"
1532,Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard more since.
1532,"As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods,--"
1532,They kill us for their sport.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,[Aside.] How should this be?--
1532,"Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,"
1532,"Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Is that the naked fellow?
1532,
1532,Old Man.
1532,"Ay, my lord."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Then pr'ythee get thee gone: if for my sake
1532,"Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,"
1532,"I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;"
1532,"And bring some covering for this naked soul,"
1532,Which I'll entreat to lead me.
1532,
1532,Old Man.
1532,"Alack, sir, he is mad."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.
1532,"Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;"
1532,"Above the rest, be gone."
1532,
1532,Old Man.
1532,"I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,"
1532,Come on't what will.
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Sirrah naked fellow,--"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Poor Tom's a-cold.
1532,[Aside.] I cannot daub it further.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Come hither, fellow."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"[Aside.] And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Know'st thou the way to Dover?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath been"
1532,"scared out of his good wits:--bless thee, good man's son, from"
1532,the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of
1532,"lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of"
1532,"stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and"
1532,"mowing,--who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. So,"
1532,"bless thee, master!"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues"
1532,Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
1532,"Makes thee the happier;--heavens, deal so still!"
1532,"Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,"
1532,"That slaves your ordinance, that will not see"
1532,"Because he does not feel, feel your power quickly;"
1532,"So distribution should undo excess,"
1532,And each man have enough.--Dost thou know Dover?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Ay, master."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"There is a cliff, whose high and bending head"
1532,Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
1532,"Bring me but to the very brim of it,"
1532,And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
1532,With something rich about me: from that place
1532,I shall no leading need.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Give me thy arm:
1532,Poor Tom shall lead thee.

1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband"
1532,"Not met us on the way.--Now, where's your master?"
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Madam, within; but never man so chang'd."
1532,I told him of the army that was landed;
1532,He smil'd at it: I told him you were coming;
1532,"His answer was, 'The worse': Of Gloster's treachery"
1532,And of the loyal service of his son
1532,"When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot"
1532,And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:--
1532,What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
1532,"What like, offensive."
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,[To Edmund.] Then shall you go no further.
1532,"It is the cowish terror of his spirit,"
1532,That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
1532,Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
1532,"May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;"
1532,Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
1532,"I must change arms at home, and give the distaff"
1532,Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
1532,"Shall pass between us; ere long you are like to hear,"
1532,"If you dare venture in your own behalf,"
1532,A mistress's command. [Giving a favour.]
1532,Wear this; spare speech;
1532,"Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,"
1532,Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:--
1532,"Conceive, and fare thee well."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Yours in the ranks of death!
1532,
1532,[Exit Edmund.]

1532,Gon.
1532,My most dear Gloster.
1532,"O, the difference of man and man!"
1532,To thee a woman's services are due:
1532,My fool usurps my body.
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Madam, here comes my lord."
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,[Enter Albany.]
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,I have been worth the whistle.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,O Goneril!
1532,You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
1532,Blows in your face! I fear your disposition:
1532,That nature which contemns it origin
1532,Cannot be bordered certain in itself;
1532,She that herself will sliver and disbranch
1532,"From her material sap, perforce must wither"
1532,And come to deadly use.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,No more; the text is foolish.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
1532,Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
1532,"Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?"
1532,"A father, and a gracious aged man,"
1532,"Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,"
1532,"Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded."
1532,Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
1532,"A man, a prince, by him so benefited!"
1532,If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
1532,"Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,"
1532,"It will come,"
1532,"Humanity must perforce prey on itself,"
1532,Like monsters of the deep.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,Milk-liver'd man!
1532,"That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;"
1532,Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
1532,Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
1532,Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
1532,Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
1532,France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;
1532,With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;
1532,"Whiles thou, a moral fool, sitt'st still, and criest"
1532,"'Alack, why does he so?'"
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"See thyself, devil!"
1532,Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
1532,So horrid as in woman.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,O vain fool!
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame!"
1532,Be-monster not thy feature! Were't my fitness
1532,To let these hands obey my blood.
1532,They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
1532,"Thy flesh and bones:--howe'er thou art a fiend,"
1532,A woman's shape doth shield thee.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Marry, your manhood now!"

1532,Alb.
1532,What news?
1532,
1532,Mess.
1532,"O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead;"
1532,"Slain by his servant, going to put out"
1532,The other eye of Gloster.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Gloster's eyes!
1532,
1532,Mess.
1532,"A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,"
1532,"Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword"
1532,"To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,"
1532,"Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;"
1532,But not without that harmful stroke which since
1532,Hath pluck'd him after.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"This shows you are above,"
1532,"You justicers, that these our nether crimes"
1532,"So speedily can venge!--But, O poor Gloster!"
1532,Lost he his other eye?
1532,
1532,Mess.
1532,"Both, both, my lord.--"
1532,"This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;"
1532,'Tis from your sister.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,[Aside.] One way I like this well;
1532,"But being widow, and my Gloster with her,"
1532,May all the building in my fancy pluck
1532,Upon my hateful life: another way
1532,"The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer."

1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,He is not here.
1532,
1532,Mess.
1532,"No, my good lord; I met him back again."
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Knows he the wickedness?
1532,
1532,Mess.
1532,"Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him;"
1532,"And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment"
1532,Might have the freer course.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Gloster, I live"
1532,"To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,"
1532,"And to revenge thine eyes.--Come hither, friend:"

1532,[Enter Kent and a Gentleman.]
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Why the king of France is so suddenly gone back know you the
1532,reason?
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming"
1532,"forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear"
1532,and danger that his personal return was most required and
1532,necessary.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Who hath he left behind him general?
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"The Mareschal of France, Monsieur La Far."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief?
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;"
1532,And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
1532,Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
1532,"Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,"
1532,Sought to be king o'er her.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"O, then it mov'd her."
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
1532,Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
1532,Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
1532,"Were like, a better day: those happy smilets"
1532,That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
1532,What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence
1532,"As pearls from diamonds dropp'd.--In brief, sorrow"
1532,"Would be a rarity most belov'd, if all"
1532,Could so become it.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Made she no verbal question?
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of 'father'"
1532,"Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;"
1532,"Cried 'Sisters, sisters!--Shame of ladies! sisters!"
1532,"Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?"
1532,Let pity not be believ'd!'--There she shook
1532,"The holy water from her heavenly eyes,"
1532,And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
1532,To deal with grief alone.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"It is the stars,"
1532,"The stars above us, govern our conditions;"
1532,Else one self mate and mate could not beget
1532,Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,No.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Was this before the king return'd?
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"No, since."

1532,Kent.
1532,"Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;"
1532,"Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers"
1532,"What we are come about, and by no means"
1532,Will yield to see his daughter.
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Why, good sir?"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,"
1532,"That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her"
1532,"To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights"
1532,"To his dog-hearted daughters,--these things sting"
1532,His mind so venomously that burning shame
1532,Detains him from Cordelia.
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Alack, poor gentleman!"
1532,
1532,Kent.

1532,And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
1532,Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;

1532,Scene VI. The country near Dover.
1532,
1532,"[Enter Gloster, and Edgar dressed like a peasant.]"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,When shall I come to the top of that same hill?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"You do climb up it now: look, how we labour."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Methinks the ground is even.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Horrible steep.
1532,"Hark, do you hear the sea?"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"No, truly."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect"
1532,By your eyes' anguish.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,So may it be indeed:
1532,Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st
1532,In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,You are much deceiv'd: in nothing am I chang'd
1532,But in my garments.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Methinks you're better spoken.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Come on, sir; here's the place:--stand still.--How fearful"
1532,And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!
1532,The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
1532,Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
1532,Hangs one that gathers samphire--dreadful trade!
1532,Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
1532,The fishermen that walk upon the beach
1532,"Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,"
1532,Diminish'd to her cock; her cock a buoy
1532,Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge
1532,That on the unnumber'd idle pebble chafes
1532,Cannot be heard so high.--I'll look no more;
1532,"Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight"
1532,Topple down headlong.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Set me where you stand.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Give me your hand:--you are now within a foot
1532,Of th' extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
1532,Would I not leap upright.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Let go my hand.
1532,"Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel"
1532,Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
1532,Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;
1532,"Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Now fare ye well, good sir."
1532,
1532,[Seems to go.]
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,With all my heart.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,[Aside.] Why I do trifle thus with his despair
1532,Is done to cure it.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,O you mighty gods!
1532,"This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,"
1532,Shake patiently my great affliction off:
1532,"If I could bear it longer, and not fall"
1532,"To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,"
1532,My snuff and loathed part of nature should
1532,"Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!--"
1532,"Now, fellow, fare thee well."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Gone, sir:--farewell.--"
1532,
1532,"[Gloster leaps, and falls along.]"
1532,
1532,And yet I know not how conceit may rob
1532,The treasury of life when life itself
1532,"Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,"
1532,By this had thought been past.--Alive or dead?
1532,"Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir?--speak!--"
1532,Thus might he pass indeed:--yet he revives.--
1532,"What are you, sir?"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Away, and let me die."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,"
1532,"So many fathom down precipitating,"
1532,Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
1532,Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
1532,Ten masts at each make not the altitude
1532,Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
1532,Thy life is a miracle.--Speak yet again.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"But have I fall'n, or no?"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
1532,Look up a-height;--the shrill-gorg'd lark so far
1532,Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Alack, I have no eyes.--"
1532,Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit
1532,To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort
1532,When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage
1532,And frustrate his proud will.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Give me your arm:
1532,Up:--so.--How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Too well, too well."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,This is above all strangeness.
1532,Upon the crown o' the cliff what thing was that
1532,Which parted from you?
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,A poor unfortunate beggar.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"As I stood here below, methought his eyes"
1532,"Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,"
1532,Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea:
1532,"It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,"
1532,"Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours"
1532,"Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
1532,"Affliction till it do cry out itself,"
1532,"'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,"
1532,"I took it for a man; often 'twould say,"
1532,"'The fiend, the fiend':--he led me to that place."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Bear free and patient thoughts.--But who comes here?
1532,
1532,"[Enter Lear, fantastically dressed up with flowers.]"
1532,
1532,The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
1532,His master thus.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"No, they cannot touch me for coining;"
1532,I am the king himself.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,O thou side-piercing sight!
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Nature 's above art in that respect.--There's your press money.
1532,That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper: draw me a
1532,"clothier's yard.--Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace;--this piece"
1532,of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it
1532,"on a giant.--Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!--i'"
1532,"the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!--Give the word."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Sweet marjoram.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Pass.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,I know that voice.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Ha! Goneril with a white beard!--They flattered me like a dog;
1532,and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were
1532,"there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said!--'Ay' and 'no',"
1532,"too, was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and"
1532,the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at
1532,"my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they"
1532,are not men o' their words: they told me I was everything; 'tis a
1532,lie--I am not ague-proof.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,The trick of that voice I do well remember:
1532,Is't not the king?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Ay, every inch a king:"
1532,"When I do stare, see how the subject quakes."
1532,I pardon that man's life.--What was thy cause?--
1532,Adultery?--
1532,Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
1532,"The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly"
1532,Does lecher in my sight.
1532,Let copulation thrive; for Gloster's bastard son
1532,Was kinder to his father than my daughters
1532,Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
1532,"To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.--"
1532,"Behold yond simpering dame,"
1532,Whose face between her forks presages snow;
1532,"That minces virtue, and does shake the head"
1532,To hear of pleasure's name;--
1532,The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't
1532,With a more riotous appetite.
1532,"Down from the waist they are centaurs,"
1532,Though women all above:
1532,"But to the girdle do the gods inherit,"
1532,"Beneath is all the fiend's; there's hell, there's darkness,"
1532,"There is the sulphurous pit; burning, scalding, stench,"
1532,"consumption; fie, fie, fie! pah, pah!"
1532,"Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my"
1532,imagination: there's money for thee.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"O, let me kiss that hand!"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
1532,Shall so wear out to naught.--Dost thou know me?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me?
1532,"No, do thy worst, blind Cupid; I'll not love.--Read thou this"
1532,challenge; mark but the penning of it.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Were all the letters suns, I could not see one."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"I would not take this from report;--it is,"
1532,And my heart breaks at it.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Read.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"What, with the case of eyes?"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money"
1532,"in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a"
1532,light: yet you see how this world goes.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,I see it feelingly.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes."
1532,Look with thine ears: see how yond justice rails upon yond simple
1532,"thief. Hark, in thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which"
1532,"is the justice, which is the thief?--Thou hast seen a farmer's"
1532,dog bark at a beggar?
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Ay, sir."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold
1532,the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.--
1532,"Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!"
1532,Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
1532,Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
1532,For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
1532,Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
1532,"Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,"
1532,And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
1532,"Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it."
1532,"None does offend, none.--I say none; I'll able 'em:"
1532,"Take that of me, my friend, who have the power"
1532,To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
1532,"And, like a scurvy politician, seem"
1532,"To see the things thou dost not.--Now, now, now, now:"
1532,"Pull off my boots: harder, harder:--so."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"O, matter and impertinency mix'd!"
1532,"Reason, in madness!"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes."
1532,I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloster:
1532,Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
1532,"Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air"
1532,We wawl and cry.--I will preach to thee: mark.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Alack, alack the day!"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"When we are born, we cry that we are come"
1532,To this great stage of fools--This' a good block:--
1532,It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
1532,"A troop of horse with felt: I'll put't in proof,;"
1532,"And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,"
1532,"Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!"
1532,
1532,"[Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants]."
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"O, here he is: lay hand upon him.--Sir,"
1532,"Your most dear daughter,--"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even"
1532,The natural fool of fortune.--Use me well;
1532,You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
1532,I am cut to the brains.
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,You shall have anything.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,No seconds? all myself?
1532,"Why, this would make a man a man of salt,"
1532,"To use his eyes for garden water-pots,"
1532,"Ay, and for laying Autumn's dust."
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Good sir,--"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!"
1532,"I will be jovial: come, come, I am a king,"
1532,"My masters, know you that."
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"You are a royal one, and we obey you."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get it"
1532,"by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!"
1532,
1532,[Exit running. Attendants follow.]
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,"
1532,Past speaking of in a king!--Thou hast one daughter
1532,Who redeems nature from the general curse
1532,Which twain have brought her to.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Hail, gentle sir."
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Sir, speed you. What's your will?"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?"
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that
1532,Which can distinguish sound.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"But, by your favour,"
1532,How near's the other army?
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
1532,Stands on the hourly thought.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,I thank you sir: that's all.
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Though that the queen on special cause is here,"
1532,Her army is mov'd on.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"I thank you, sir."
1532,
1532,[Exit Gentleman.]
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;"
1532,Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
1532,To die before you please!
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Well pray you, father."
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Now, good sir, what are you?"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;"
1532,"Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,"
1532,"Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,"
1532,I'll lead you to some biding.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Hearty thanks:
1532,The bounty and the benison of heaven
1532,"To boot, and boot!"
1532,
1532,[Enter Oswald.]
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
1532,That eyeless head of thine was first fram'd flesh
1532,"To raise my fortunes.--Thou old unhappy traitor,"
1532,Briefly thyself remember:--the sword is out
1532,That must destroy thee.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,Now let thy friendly hand
1532,Put strength enough to it.
1532,
1532,[Edgar interposes.]
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Wherefore, bold peasant,"
1532,Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;
1532,Lest that the infection of his fortune take
1532,Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion."
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Let go, slave, or thou diest!"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. An chud"
1532,"ha' bin zwaggered out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo long as"
1532,"'tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near the old man; keep out,"
1532,"che vore ye, or ise try whether your costard or my bat be the"
1532,harder: chill be plain with you.
1532,
1532,Osw.
1532,"Out, dunghill!"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your foins."
1532,
1532,"[They fight, and Edgar knocks him down.]"

1532,Osw.
1532,"Slave, thou hast slain me:--villain, take my purse:"
1532,"If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;"
1532,And give the letters which thou find'st about me
1532,To Edmund Earl of Gloster; seek him out
1532,"Upon the British party: O, untimely death!"
1532,[Dies.]
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
1532,As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
1532,As badness would desire.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"What, is he dead?"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Sit you down, father; rest you.--"
1532,Let's see these pockets; the letters that he speaks of
1532,May be my friends.--He's dead; I am only sorry
1532,He had no other death's-man. Let us see:--
1532,"Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:"
1532,"To know our enemies' minds, we'd rip their hearts;"
1532,Their papers is more lawful.
1532,[Reads.] 'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have many
1532,"opportunities to cut him off: if your will want not, time and"
1532,place will be fruitfully offered. There is nothing done if he
1532,"return the conqueror: then am I the prisoner, and his bed my"

1532,place for your labour.
1532,"'Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant,"
1532,'Goneril.'
1532,O indistinguish'd space of woman's will!
1532,A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
1532,And the exchange my brother!--Here in the sands
1532,"Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified"
1532,Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
1532,With this ungracious paper strike the sight
1532,Of the death-practis'd duke: for him 'tis well
1532,That of thy death and business I can tell.
1532,
1532,"[Exit Edgar, dragging out the body.]"
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,"
1532,"That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling"
1532,Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:
1532,"So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,"
1532,And woes by wrong imaginations lose
1532,The knowledge of themselves.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Give me your hand:
1532,[A drum afar off.]
1532,Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum:
1532,"Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend."

1532,
1532,Phys.
1532,"Madam, sleeps still."
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"O you kind gods,"
1532,Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
1532,"The untun'd and jarring senses, O, wind up"
1532,Of this child-changed father!
1532,
1532,Phys.
1532,So please your majesty
1532,That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed"
1532,I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep"
1532,We put fresh garments on him.
1532,
1532,Phys.
1532,"Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;"
1532,I doubt not of his temperance.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,Very well.
1532,
1532,Phys.
1532,Please you draw near.--Louder the music there!
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,O my dear father! Restoration hang
1532,Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
1532,Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
1532,Have in thy reverence made!
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Kind and dear princess!
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"Had you not been their father, these white flakes"
1532,Had challeng'd pity of them. Was this a face
1532,To be oppos'd against the warring winds?
1532,To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
1532,In the most terrible and nimble stroke
1532,"Of quick cross lightning? to watch--,poor perdu!--"
1532,"With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,"
1532,"Though he had bit me, should have stood that night"
1532,"Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,"
1532,"To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,"
1532,"In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!"
1532,'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
1532,Had not concluded all.--He wakes; speak to him.
1532,
1532,Doct.
1532,"Madam, do you; 'tis fittest."
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:--
1532,Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
1532,"Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears"
1532,Do scald like molten lead.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"Sir, do you know me?"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?"
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"Still, still, far wide!"
1532,
1532,Phys.
1532,He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Where have I been? Where am I?--Fair daylight,--"
1532,"I am mightily abus'd.--I should e'en die with pity,"
1532,To see another thus.--I know not what to say.--
1532,I will not swear these are my hands:--let's see;
1532,I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd
1532,Of my condition!
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"O, look upon me, sir,"
1532,And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.--
1532,"No, sir, you must not kneel."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Pray, do not mock me:"
1532,"I am a very foolish fond old man,"
1532,"Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;"
1532,"And, to deal plainly,"
1532,I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
1532,"Methinks I should know you, and know this man;"
1532,Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant
1532,What place this is; and all the skill I have
1532,Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
1532,Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
1532,"For, as I am a man, I think this lady"
1532,To be my child Cordelia.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,And so I am. I am.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Be your tears wet? yes, faith. I pray, weep not:"
1532,"If you have poison for me, I will drink it."
1532,I know you do not love me; for your sisters
1532,"Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:"
1532,"You have some cause, they have not."
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,"No cause, no cause."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Am I in France?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"In your own kingdom, sir."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,Do not abuse me.
1532,
1532,Phys.
1532,"Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,"
1532,"You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger"
1532,To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
1532,Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
1532,Till further settling.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,Will't please your highness walk?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,You must bear with me:
1532,"Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish."
1532,
1532,"[Exeunt Lear, Cordelia, Physician, and Attendants.]"
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Most certain, sir."
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,Who is conductor of his people?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloster."
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl of Kent"
1532,in Germany.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers of
1532,the kingdom approach apace.
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,The arbitrement is like to be bloody.
1532,"Fare you well, sir."
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"My point and period will be throughly wrought,"
1532,"Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought."

1532,
1532,Scene I. The Camp of the British Forces near Dover.
1532,
1532,"[Enter, with drum and colours, Edmund, Regan, Officers, Soldiers,"
1532,and others.]
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,"
1532,Or whether since he is advis'd by aught
1532,To change the course: he's full of alteration
1532,And self-reproving:--bring his constant pleasure.
1532,
1532,"[To an Officer, who goes out.]"
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Tis to be doubted, madam."
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"Now, sweet lord,"
1532,You know the goodness I intend upon you:
1532,"Tell me,--but truly,--but then speak the truth,"
1532,Do you not love my sister?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,In honour'd love.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,But have you never found my brother's way
1532,To the forfended place?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,That thought abuses you.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
1532,"And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"No, by mine honour, madam."
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"I never shall endure her: dear my lord,"
1532,Be not familiar with her.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Fear me not:--
1532,She and the duke her husband!
1532,
1532,"[Enter, with drum and colours, Albany, Goneril, and Soldiers.]"
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,[Aside.] I had rather lose the battle than that sister
1532,Should loosen him and me.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Our very loving sister, well be-met.--"
1532,"Sir, this I heard,--the king is come to his daughter,"
1532,With others whom the rigour of our state
1532,"Forc'd to cry out. Where I could not be honest,"
1532,"I never yet was valiant: for this business,"
1532,"It toucheth us, as France invades our land,"
1532,"Not bolds the king, with others whom, I fear,"
1532,Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Sir, you speak nobly."
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,Why is this reason'd?
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
1532,For these domestic and particular broils
1532,Are not the question here.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Let's, then, determine"
1532,With the ancient of war on our proceeding.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,I shall attend you presently at your tent.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"Sister, you'll go with us?"
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,No.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us."
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"[Aside.] O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go."
1532,
1532,"[As they are going out, enter Edgar disguised.]"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,"
1532,Hear me one word.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,I'll overtake you.--Speak.

1532,"[Exeunt Edmund, Regan, Goneril, Officers, Soldiers, and"
1532,Attendants.]
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Before you fight the battle, ope this letter."
1532,"If you have victory, let the trumpet sound"
1532,"For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,"
1532,I can produce a champion that will prove
1532,"What is avouched there. If you miscarry,"
1532,"Your business of the world hath so an end,"
1532,And machination ceases. Fortune love you!
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Stay till I have read the letter.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,I was forbid it.
1532,"When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,"
1532,And I'll appear again.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper."
1532,
1532,[Exit Edgar.]
1532,
1532,[Re-enter Edmund.]
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
1532,Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
1532,By diligent discovery;--but your haste
1532,Is now urg'd on you.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,We will greet the time.
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
1532,"Each jealous of the other, as the stung"
1532,Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
1532,"Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,"
1532,If both remain alive: to take the widow
1532,"Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;"
1532,"And hardly shall I carry out my side,"
1532,"Her husband being alive. Now, then, we'll use"
1532,"His countenance for the battle; which being done,"
1532,Let her who would be rid of him devise
1532,His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
1532,"Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,--"
1532,"The battle done, and they within our power,"
1532,Shall never see his pardon: for my state
1532,"Stands on me to defend, not to debate."

1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Here, father, take the shadow of this tree"
1532,For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
1532,"If ever I return to you again,"
1532,I'll bring you comfort.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"Grace go with you, sir!"
1532,
1532,[Exit Edgar].
1532,
1532,[Alarum and retreat within. R-enter Edgar.]
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Away, old man,--give me thy hand,--away!"
1532,"King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:"
1532,Give me thy hand; come on!
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,"No further, sir; a man may rot even here."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure"
1532,"Their going hence, even as their coming hither;"
1532,Ripeness is all:--come on.
1532,
1532,Glou.
1532,And that's true too.
1532,
1532,[Exeunt.]

1532,Scene III. The British Camp near Dover.
1532,
1532,"[Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, Edmund; Lear and"
1532,"Cordelia prisoners; Officers, Soldiers, &c.]"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Some officers take them away: good guard
1532,Until their greater pleasures first be known
1532,That are to censure them.
1532,
1532,Cor.
1532,We are not the first
1532,Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.
1532,"For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;"
1532,Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.--
1532,Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:"
1532,We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
1532,When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down
1532,"And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,"
1532,"And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh"
1532,"At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues"
1532,"Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,--"
1532,"Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;--"
1532,"And take upon's the mystery of things,"
1532,"As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,"
1532,"In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones"
1532,That ebb and flow by the moon.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Take them away.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,"
1532,The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
1532,He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
1532,And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
1532,"The goodyears shall devour them, flesh and fell,"
1532,Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve first.
1532,Come.
1532,
1532,"[Exeunt Lear and Cordelia, guarded.]"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Come hither, captain; hark."
1532,Take thou this note [giving a paper]; go follow them to prison:
1532,One step I have advanc'd thee; if thou dost
1532,"As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way"
1532,"To noble fortunes: know thou this,--that men"
1532,Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
1532,Does not become a sword:--thy great employment
1532,"Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do't,"
1532,Or thrive by other means.
1532,
1532,Capt.
1532,"I'll do't, my lord."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
1532,"Mark,--I say, instantly; and carry it so"
1532,As I have set it down.
1532,
1532,Capt.
1532,"I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;"
1532,"If it be man's work, I'll do't."
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,"[Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Officers, and"
1532,Attendants.]
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,"
1532,And fortune led you well: you have the captives
1532,Who were the opposites of this day's strife:
1532,"We do require them of you, so to use them"
1532,As we shall find their merits and our safety
1532,May equally determine.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Sir, I thought it fit"
1532,To send the old and miserable king
1532,To some retention and appointed guard;
1532,"Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,"
1532,"To pluck the common bosom on his side,"
1532,And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
1532,Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
1532,My reason all the same; and they are ready
1532,"To-morrow, or at further space, to appear"
1532,Where you shall hold your session. At this time
1532,We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
1532,"And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd"
1532,By those that feel their sharpness:--
1532,The question of Cordelia and her father
1532,Requires a fitter place.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Sir, by your patience,"
1532,"I hold you but a subject of this war,"
1532,Not as a brother.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,That's as we list to grace him.
1532,Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
1532,Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
1532,Bore the commission of my place and person;
1532,The which immediacy may well stand up
1532,And call itself your brother.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,Not so hot:
1532,"In his own grace he doth exalt himself,"
1532,More than in your addition.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,In my rights
1532,"By me invested, he compeers the best."
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,That were the most if he should husband you.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,Jesters do oft prove prophets.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Holla, holla!"
1532,That eye that told you so look'd but asquint.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"Lady, I am not well; else I should answer"
1532,"From a full-flowing stomach.--General,"
1532,"Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;"
1532,"Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:"
1532,Witness the world that I create thee here
1532,My lord and master.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,Mean you to enjoy him?
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,The let-alone lies not in your good will.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Nor in thine, lord."
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Half-blooded fellow, yes."
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"[To Edmund.] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine."
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Stay yet; hear reason.--Edmund, I arrest thee"
1532,"On capital treason; and, in thine arrest,"
1532,"This gilded serpent [pointing to Goneril.],--For your claim, fair"
1532,"sister,"
1532,I bar it in the interest of my wife;
1532,"'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,"
1532,"And I, her husband, contradict your bans."
1532,"If you will marry, make your loves to me,--"
1532,My lady is bespoke.
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,An interlude!
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Thou art arm'd, Gloster:--let the trumpet sound:"
1532,If none appear to prove upon thy person
1532,"Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,"
1532,There is my pledge [throwing down a glove]; I'll prove it on thy
1532,"heart,"
1532,"Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less"
1532,Than I have here proclaim'd thee.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,"Sick, O, sick!"
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"[Aside.] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine."
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,There's my exchange [throwing down a glove]: what in the world he
1532,is
1532,"That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:"
1532,"Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,"
1532,"On him, on you, who not? I will maintain"
1532,My truth and honour firmly.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"A herald, ho!"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"A herald, ho, a herald!"
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,"
1532,"All levied in my name, have in my name"
1532,Took their discharge.
1532,
1532,Reg.
1532,My sickness grows upon me.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,She is not well. Convey her to my tent.
1532,
1532,"[Exit Regan, led.]"
1532,
1532,[Enter a Herald.]
1532,
1532,"Come hither, herald.--Let the trumpet sound,--"
1532,And read out this.
1532,
1532,Officer.
1532,"Sound, trumpet!"
1532,
1532,[A trumpet sounds.]
1532,
1532,Her.
1532,[Reads.] 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists of
1532,"the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloster,"
1532,"that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound"
1532,of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Sound!
1532,
1532,[First trumpet.]
1532,
1532,Her.
1532,Again!
1532,
1532,[Second trumpet.]
1532,
1532,Her.
1532,Again!
1532,
1532,"[Third trumpet. Trumpet answers within. Enter Edgar, armed,"
1532,preceded by a trumpet.]
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Ask him his purposes, why he appears"
1532,Upon this call o' the trumpet.
1532,
1532,Her.
1532,What are you?
1532,"Your name, your quality? and why you answer"
1532,This present summons?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Know, my name is lost;"
1532,By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.
1532,Yet am I noble as the adversary
1532,I come to cope.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Which is that adversary?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloster?
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Himself:--what say'st thou to him?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Draw thy sword,"
1532,"That, if my speech offend a noble heart,"
1532,Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
1532,"Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,"
1532,"My oath, and my profession: I protest,--"
1532,"Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,"
1532,"Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,"
1532,"Thy valour and thy heart,--thou art a traitor;"
1532,"False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;"
1532,Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince;
1532,"And, from the extremest upward of thy head"
1532,"To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,"
1532,"A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'"
1532,"This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent"
1532,"To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,"
1532,Thou liest.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,In wisdom I should ask thy name;
1532,"But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,"
1532,"And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,"
1532,What safe and nicely I might well delay
1532,"By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:"
1532,Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;
1532,With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
1532,"Which,--for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,--"
1532,"This sword of mine shall give them instant way,"
1532,"Where they shall rest for ever.--Trumpets, speak!"
1532,
1532,[Alarums. They fight. Edmund falls.]
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Save him, save him!"
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"This is mere practice, Gloster:"
1532,By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
1532,"An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,"
1532,But cozen'd and beguil'd.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Shut your mouth, dame,"
1532,"Or with this paper shall I stop it:--Hold, sir;"
1532,"Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:--"
1532,"No tearing, lady; I perceive you know it."
1532,
1532,[Gives the letter to Edmund.]
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,"Say if I do,--the laws are mine, not thine:"
1532,Who can arraign me for't?
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Most monstrous!
1532,Know'st thou this paper?
1532,
1532,Gon.
1532,Ask me not what I know.
1532,
1532,[Exit.]
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.
1532,
1532,"[To an Officer, who goes out.]"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done;"
1532,"And more, much more; the time will bring it out:"
1532,"'Tis past, and so am I.--But what art thou"
1532,"That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,"
1532,I do forgive thee.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Let's exchange charity.
1532,"I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;"
1532,"If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me."
1532,"My name is Edgar, and thy father's son."
1532,"The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices"
1532,Make instruments to plague us:
1532,The dark and vicious place where thee he got
1532,Cost him his eyes.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Thou hast spoken right; 'tis true;
1532,The wheel is come full circle; I am here.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Methought thy very gait did prophesy
1532,A royal nobleness:--I must embrace thee:
1532,Let sorrow split my heart if ever I
1532,Did hate thee or thy father!
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Worthy prince, I know't."
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Where have you hid yourself?
1532,How have you known the miseries of your father?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"By nursing them, my lord.--List a brief tale;--"
1532,"And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!--"
1532,"The bloody proclamation to escape,"
1532,"That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!"
1532,That with the pain of death we'd hourly die
1532,Rather than die at once!)--taught me to shift
1532,Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
1532,That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit
1532,"Met I my father with his bleeding rings,"
1532,"Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,"
1532,"Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;"
1532,"Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him"
1532,"Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd;"
1532,"Not sure, though hoping of this good success,"
1532,"I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last"
1532,"Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,--"
1532,"Alack, too weak the conflict to support!--"
1532,"'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,"
1532,Burst smilingly.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"This speech of yours hath mov'd me,"
1532,And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
1532,You look as you had something more to say.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;"
1532,"For I am almost ready to dissolve,"
1532,Hearing of this.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,This would have seem'd a period
1532,"To such as love not sorrow; but another,"
1532,"To amplify too much, would make much more,"
1532,And top extremity.
1532,"Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man"
1532,"Who, having seen me in my worst estate,"
1532,"Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding"
1532,"Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms"
1532,"He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out"
1532,As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;
1532,Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
1532,That ever ear receiv'd: which in recounting
1532,"His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life"
1532,"Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,"
1532,And there I left him tranc'd.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,But who was this?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise"
1532,Follow'd his enemy king and did him service
1532,Improper for a slave.
1532,
1532,"[Enter a Gentleman hastily, with a bloody knife.]"
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Help, help! O, help!"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,What kind of help?
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Speak, man."
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,What means that bloody knife?
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"'Tis hot, it smokes;"
1532,It came even from the heart of--O! she's dead!
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Who dead? speak, man."
1532,
1532,Gent.
1532,"Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister"
1532,By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,I was contracted to them both: all three
1532,Now marry in an instant.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Here comes Kent.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:--"
1532,"This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble"
1532,Touches us not with pity. [Exit Gentleman.]
1532,
1532,[Enter Kent.]
1532,
1532,"O, is this he?"
1532,The time will not allow the compliment
1532,That very manners urges.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,I am come
1532,To bid my king and master aye good night:
1532,Is he not here?
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Great thing of us forgot!
1532,"Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?"
1532,
1532,[The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.]
1532,
1532,"Seest thou this object, Kent?"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Alack, why thus?"
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,Yet Edmund was belov'd.
1532,"The one the other poisoned for my sake,"
1532,And after slew herself.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Even so.--Cover their faces.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"I pant for life:--some good I mean to do,"
1532,"Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,--"
1532,"Be brief in it,--to the castle; for my writ"
1532,Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:--
1532,"Nay, send in time."
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Run, run, O, run!"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"To who, my lord?--Who has the office? send"
1532,Thy token of reprieve.
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,"Well thought on: take my sword,"
1532,Give it the Captain.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Haste thee for thy life.
1532,
1532,[Exit Edgar.]
1532,
1532,Edm.
1532,He hath commission from thy wife and me
1532,"To hang Cordelia in the prison, and"
1532,"To lay the blame upon her own despair,"
1532,That she fordid herself.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,The gods defend her!--Bear him hence awhile.
1532,
1532,[Edmund is borne off.]
1532,
1532,"[Re-enter Lear, with Cordelia dead in his arms; Edgar, Officer,"
1532,and others following.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Howl, howl, howl, howl!--O, you are men of stone."
1532,"Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so"
1532,That heaven's vault should crack.--She's gone for ever!--
1532,"I know when one is dead, and when one lives;"
1532,She's dead as earth.--Lend me a looking glass;
1532,"If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,"
1532,"Why, then she lives."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,Is this the promis'd end?
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Or image of that horror?
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,"Fall, and cease!"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,"
1532,It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
1532,That ever I have felt.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,O my good master! [Kneeling.]
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Pr'ythee, away!"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"'Tis noble Kent, your friend."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!"
1532,I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!--
1532,"Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!"
1532,"What is't thou say'st?--Her voice was ever soft,"
1532,"Gentle, and low,--an excellent thing in woman.--"
1532,I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
1532,
1532,Off.
1532,"'Tis true, my lords, he did."
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Did I not, fellow?"
1532,"I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion"
1532,"I would have made them skip: I am old now,"
1532,And these same crosses spoil me.--Who are you?
1532,Mine eyes are not o' the best:--I'll tell you straight.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,"
1532,One of them we behold.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"The same,"
1532,Your servant Kent.--Where is your servant Caius?
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;"
1532,"He'll strike, and quickly too:--he's dead and rotten."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"No, my good lord; I am the very man,--"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,I'll see that straight.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,That from your first of difference and decay
1532,Have follow'd your sad steps.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,You are welcome hither.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Nor no man else:--All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.--"
1532,"Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,"
1532,And desperately are dead.
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"Ay, so I think."
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,He knows not what he says; and vain is it
1532,That we present us to him.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,Very bootless.
1532,
1532,[Enter a Officer.]
1532,
1532,Off.
1532,"Edmund is dead, my lord."
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,That's but a trifle here.--
1532,"You lords and noble friends, know our intent."
1532,What comfort to this great decay may come
1532,"Shall be applied: for us, we will resign,"
1532,"During the life of this old majesty,"
1532,To him our absolute power:--[to Edgar and Kent] you to your
1532,rights;
1532,"With boot, and such addition as your honours"
1532,Have more than merited.--All friends shall taste
1532,"The wages of their virtue, and all foes"
1532,"The cup of their deservings.--O, see, see!"
1532,
1532,Lear.
1532,"And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!"
1532,"Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,"
1532,"And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,"
1532,"Never, never, never, never, never!--"
1532,"Pray you undo this button:--thank you, sir.--"
1532,Do you see this? Look on her!--look!--her lips!--
1532,"Look there, look there!--"
1532,
1532,[He dies.]
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"He faints!--My lord, my lord!--"
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Break, heart; I pr'ythee break!"
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,"Look up, my lord."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him"
1532,That would upon the rack of this rough world
1532,Stretch him out longer.
1532,
1532,Edg.
1532,He is gone indeed.
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long:"
1532,He but usurp'd his life.
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,Bear them from hence.--Our present business
1532,"Is general woe.--[To Kent and Edgar.] Friends of my soul, you"
1532,twain
1532,"Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain."
1532,
1532,Kent.
1532,"I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;"
1532,"My master calls me,--I must not say no."
1532,
1532,Alb.
1532,The weight of this sad time we must obey;
1532,"Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say."
1532,The oldest have borne most: we that are young
1532,"Shall never see so much, nor live so long."
1532,
1532,"[Exeunt, with a dead march.]"
