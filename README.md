# Welcome to the Data Club at the University of Leicester

This is a place for sharing data, ideas and solutions for the Data Club at the University of Leicester.

We will be working on different types of real world data and at each session experts will introduce their data and their possible applications.

## Session 1
Our first sets of data are [here](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/odata/v1/Products('511e6bd8-77a1-4c94-910e-97e90b9b172b')/$value) (you will need to register [here](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/self-registration) first). This data will be used in out Copernicus hackathon later on this year.

## Session 2
 Dr Paul King has kindly produced the following two examples of analysing text from works of Shakespear and US patents using R Studio. Here is the the [zip file](DataClub/TextMiningUsingR/Shakespear/Romeo.zip) including the [data files](DataClub/TextMiningUsingR/Shakespear/Romeo/Data/), the RStudio [project file](DataClub/TextMiningUsingR/Shakespear/Romeo/RandJ.Rmd) and a [html version of the commands](DataClub/TextMiningUsingR/Shakespear/Romeo/RandJ.html).
