1514,
1514,
1514,
1514,"SCENE: Athens, and a wood not far from it."
1514,
1514,ACT I.
1514,
1514,SCENE I. Athens. A room in the Palace of THESEUS.
1514,
1514,"[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants.]"
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour"
1514,Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
1514,"Another moon; but, oh, methinks, how slow"
1514,"This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,"
1514,"Like to a step-dame or a dowager,"
1514,Long withering out a young man's revenue.
1514,
1514,HIPPOLYTA
1514,Four days will quickly steep themselves in nights;
1514,Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
1514,"And then the moon, like to a silver bow"
1514,"New bent in heaven, shall behold the night"
1514,Of our solemnities.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"                    Go, Philostrate,"
1514,Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
1514,Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
1514,Turn melancholy forth to funerals--
1514,The pale companion is not for our pomp. --
1514,
1514,[Exit PHILOSTRATE.]
1514,
1514,"Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,"
1514,And won thy love doing thee injuries;
1514,"But I will wed thee in another key,"
1514,"With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling."
1514,
1514,"[Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS.]"
1514,
1514,EGEUS
1514,"Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!"
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?"
1514,
1514,EGEUS
1514,"Full of vexation come I, with complaint"
1514,"Against my child, my daughter Hermia.--"
1514,"Stand forth, Demetrius.--My noble lord,"
1514,This man hath my consent to marry her:--
1514,"Stand forth, Lysander;--and, my gracious duke,"
1514,This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child.
1514,"Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,"
1514,And interchang'd love-tokens with my child:
1514,"Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,"
1514,"With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;"
1514,And stol'n the impression of her fantasy
1514,"With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,"
1514,"Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats,--messengers"
1514,Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth;--
1514,With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;
1514,"Turned her obedience, which is due to me,"
1514,"To stubborn harshness.--And, my gracious duke,"
1514,Be it so she will not here before your grace
1514,"Consent to marry with Demetrius,"
1514,"I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,--"
1514,As she is mine I may dispose of her:
1514,Which shall be either to this gentleman
1514,Or to her death; according to our law
1514,Immediately provided in that case.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"What say you, Hermia? be advis'd, fair maid:"
1514,To you your father should be as a god;
1514,"One that compos'd your beauties: yea, and one"
1514,"To whom you are but as a form in wax,"
1514,"By him imprinted, and within his power"
1514,"To leave the figure, or disfigure it."
1514,Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,So is Lysander.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,                In himself he is:
1514,"But, in this kind, wanting your father's voice,"
1514,The other must be held the worthier.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
1514,"I know not by what power I am made bold,"
1514,Nor how it may concern my modesty
1514,In such a presence here to plead my thoughts:
1514,But I beseech your grace that I may know
1514,The worst that may befall me in this case
1514,If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"Either to die the death, or to abjure"
1514,For ever the society of men.
1514,"Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,"
1514,"Know of your youth, examine well your blood,"
1514,"Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,"
1514,You can endure the livery of a nun;
1514,"For aye to be shady cloister mew'd,"
1514,"To live a barren sister all your life,"
1514,"Chanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon."
1514,Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood
1514,To undergo such maiden pilgrimage:
1514,But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd
1514,"Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,"
1514,"Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness."
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,"
1514,Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
1514,"Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke"
1514,My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"Take time to pause; and by the next new moon,--"
1514,The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
1514,"For everlasting bond of fellowship,--"
1514,Upon that day either prepare to die
1514,For disobedience to your father's will;
1514,"Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;"
1514,Or on Diana's altar to protest
1514,For aye austerity and single life.
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"Relent, sweet Hermia;--and, Lysander, yield"
1514,Thy crazed title to my certain right.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"You have her father's love, Demetrius;"
1514,Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
1514,
1514,EGEUS
1514,"Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love;"
1514,And what is mine my love shall render him;
1514,And she is mine; and all my right of her
1514,I do estate unto Demetrius.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"I am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,"
1514,As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
1514,"My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,"
1514,"If not with vantage, as Demetrius's;"
1514,"And, which is more than all these boasts can be,"
1514,I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia:
1514,Why should not I then prosecute my right?
1514,"Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,"
1514,"Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,"
1514,"And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,"
1514,"Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,"
1514,Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"I must confess that I have heard so much,"
1514,And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
1514,"But, being over-full of self-affairs,"
1514,"My mind did lose it.--But, Demetrius, come;"
1514,"And come, Egeus; you shall go with me;"
1514,I have some private schooling for you both.--
1514,"For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself"
1514,"To fit your fancies to your father's will,"
1514,"Or else the law of Athens yields you up,--"
1514,"Which by no means we may extenuate,--"
1514,"To death, or to a vow of single life.--"
1514,"Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?"
1514,"Demetrius, and Egeus, go along;"
1514,I must employ you in some business
1514,"Against our nuptial, and confer with you"
1514,Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
1514,
1514,EGEUS
1514,With duty and desire we follow you.
1514,
1514,"[Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, DEMETRIUS, and Train.]"
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?"
1514,How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"Belike for want of rain, which I could well"
1514,Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"Ah me! for aught that I could ever read,"
1514,"Could ever hear by tale or history,"
1514,The course of true love never did run smooth:
1514,"But either it was different in blood,--"
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,O cross! Too high to be enthrall'd to low!
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,Or else misgraffed in respect of years;--
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,O spite! Too old to be engag'd to young!
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,Or else it stood upon the choice of friends:
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,O hell! to choose love by another's eye!
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,"
1514,"War, death, or sickness, did lay siege to it,"
1514,"Making it momentary as a sound,"
1514,"Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;"
1514,Brief as the lightning in the collied night
1514,"That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,"
1514,"And ere a man hath power to say, Behold!"
1514,The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
1514,So quick bright things come to confusion.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"If then true lovers have ever cross'd,"
1514,It stands as an edict in destiny:
1514,"Then let us teach our trial patience,"
1514,Because it is a customary cross;
1514,"As due to love as thoughts, and dreams, and sighs,"
1514,"Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers."
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia."
1514,"I have a widow aunt, a dowager"
1514,"Of great revenue, and she hath no child:"
1514,From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
1514,And she respects me as her only son.
1514,"There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;"
1514,And to that place the sharp Athenian law
1514,"Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,"
1514,Steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night;
1514,"And in the wood, a league without the town,"
1514,"Where I did meet thee once with Helena,"
1514,"To do observance to a morn of May,"
1514,There will I stay for thee.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,                            My good Lysander!
1514,"I swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,"
1514,"By his best arrow, with the golden head,"
1514,"By the simplicity of Venus' doves,"
1514,"By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,"
1514,"And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,"
1514,"When the false Trojan under sail was seen,--"
1514,"By all the vows that ever men have broke,"
1514,"In number more than ever women spoke,--"
1514,"In that same place thou hast appointed me,"
1514,Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena."
1514,
1514,[Enter HELENA.]
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,God speed fair Helena! Whither away?
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
1514,Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!
1514,Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
1514,"More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,"
1514,"When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear."
1514,"Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,"
1514,"Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;"
1514,"My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,"
1514,My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
1514,"Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,"
1514,The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
1514,"O, teach me how you look; and with what art"
1514,You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart!
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"I frown upon him, yet he loves me still."
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"I give him curses, yet he gives me love."
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,O that my prayers could such affection move!
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"The more I hate, the more he follows me."
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"The more I love, the more he hateth me."
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine."
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!"
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,Take comfort; he no more shall see my face;
1514,Lysander and myself will fly this place.--
1514,"Before the time I did Lysander see,"
1514,Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
1514,"O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,"
1514,That he hath turn'd a heaven unto hell!
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:"
1514,"To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold"
1514,"Her silver visage in the watery glass,"
1514,"Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,--"
1514,"A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,--"
1514,Through Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,And in the wood where often you and I
1514,"Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,"
1514,"Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,"
1514,There my Lysander and myself shall meet:
1514,"And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,"
1514,To seek new friends and stranger companies.
1514,"Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us,"
1514,And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!--
1514,"Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight"
1514,"From lovers' food, till morrow deep midnight."
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"I will, my Hermia."
1514,
1514,[Exit HERMIA.]
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"                   Helena, adieu:"
1514,"As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!"
1514,
1514,[Exit LYSANDER.]
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,How happy some o'er other some can be!
1514,Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
1514,But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
1514,He will not know what all but he do know.
1514,"And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,"
1514,"So I, admiring of his qualities."
1514,"Things base and vile, holding no quantity,"
1514,Love can transpose to form and dignity.
1514,"Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;"
1514,And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.
1514,Nor hath love's mind of any judgment taste;
1514,Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
1514,"And therefore is love said to be a child,"
1514,Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd.
1514,"As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,"
1514,So the boy Love is perjur'd everywhere:
1514,"For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,"
1514,He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
1514,"And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,"
1514,"So he dissolv'd, and showers of oaths did melt."
1514,I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight;
1514,Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
1514,Pursue her; and for this intelligence
1514,"If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:"
1514,"But herein mean I to enrich my pain,"
1514,To have his sight thither and back again.
1514,
1514,[Exit HELENA.]
1514,
1514,
1514,
1514,SCENE II. The Same. A Room in a Cottage.
1514,
1514,"[Enter SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, QUINCE, and STARVELING.]"
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,Is all our company here?
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"You were best to call them generally, man by man,"
1514,according to the scrip.
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is thought"
1514,"fit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the"
1514,duke and duchess on his wedding-day at night.
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on;"
1514,then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Marry, our play is--The most lamentable comedy and most"
1514,cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry.--"
1514,"Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll.--"
1514,"Masters, spread yourselves."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Answer, as I call you.--Nick Bottom, the weaver."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?"
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,That will ask some tears in the true performing of it.
1514,"If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move"
1514,storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest:--yet my
1514,"chief humour is for a tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a"
1514,"part to tear a cat in, to make all split."
1514,
1514,The raging rocks
1514,And shivering shocks
1514,Shall break the locks
1514,    Of prison gates:
1514,
1514,And Phibbus' car
1514,"Shall shine from far,"
1514,And make and mar
1514,    The foolish Fates.
1514,
1514,This was lofty.--Now name the rest of the players.--This is
1514,"Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein;--a lover is more condoling."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Francis Flute, the bellows-mender."
1514,
1514,FLUTE
1514,"Here, Peter Quince."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Flute, you must take Thisby on you."
1514,
1514,FLUTE
1514,What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
1514,
1514,FLUTE
1514,"Nay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"That's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as"
1514,small as you will.
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too:"
1514,"I'll speak in a monstrous little voice;--'Thisne, Thisne!'--"
1514,"'Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear; thy Thisby dear! and lady dear!'"
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Well, proceed."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Robin Starveling, the tailor."
1514,
1514,STARVELING
1514,"Here, Peter Quince."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.--"
1514,"Tom Snout, the tinker."
1514,
1514,SNOUT
1514,"Here, Peter Quince."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"You, Pyramus' father; myself, Thisby's father;--Snug,"
1514,"the joiner, you, the lion's part:--and, I hope, here is a play"
1514,fitted.

1514,"me, for I am slow of study."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,Let me play the lion too: I will roar that I will do
1514,any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar that I will make the
1514,"duke say 'Let him roar again, let him roar again.'"
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"An you should do it too terribly, you would fright the"
1514,"duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were"
1514,enough to hang us all.
1514,
1514,ALL
1514,That would hang us every mother's son.
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies"
1514,"out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang"
1514,"us: but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as"
1514,gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
1514,nightingale.
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
1514,"sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's"
1514,day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must
1514,needs play Pyramus.
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?"
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Why, what you will."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard,"
1514,"your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your"
1514,"French-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and"
1514,"then you will play bare-faced.-- But, masters, here are your"
1514,"parts: and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to"
1514,"con them by to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a"
1514,"mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse: for"
1514,"if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg'd with company, and our"
1514,"devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties,"
1514,"such as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,We will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely
1514,and courageously. Take pains; be perfect; adieu.

1514,ACT II.
1514,
1514,
1514,SCENE I. A wood near Athens.
1514,
1514,"[Enter a FAIRY at One door, and PUCK at another.]"
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"How now, spirit! whither wander you?"
1514,
1514,FAIRY
1514,"    Over hill, over dale,"
1514,"      Thorough bush, thorough brier,"
1514,"    Over park, over pale,"
1514,"      Thorough flood, thorough fire,"
1514,"    I do wander everywhere,"
1514,    Swifter than the moon's sphere;
1514,"    And I serve the fairy queen,"
1514,    To dew her orbs upon the green.
1514,    The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
1514,    In their gold coats spots you see;
1514,"    Those be rubies, fairy favours,"
1514,    In those freckles live their savours;
1514,"I must go seek some dew-drops here,"
1514,And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
1514,"Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:"
1514,Our queen and all her elves come here anon.
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,The king doth keep his revels here to-night;
1514,Take heed the Queen come not within his sight.
1514,"For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,"
1514,"Because that she, as her attendant, hath"
1514,"A lovely boy, stol'n from an Indian king;"
1514,She never had so sweet a changeling:
1514,And jealous Oberon would have the child
1514,"Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild:"
1514,"But she perforce withholds the loved boy,"
1514,"Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy:"
1514,"And now they never meet in grove or green,"
1514,"By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,"
1514,But they do square; that all their elves for fear
1514,"Creep into acorn cups, and hide them there."
1514,
1514,FAIRY
1514,"Either I mistake your shape and making quite,"
1514,Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
1514,Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
1514,That frights the maidens of the villagery;
1514,"Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern,"
1514,And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
1514,And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
1514,"Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?"
1514,"Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,"
1514,"You do their work, and they shall have good luck:"
1514,Are not you he?
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,                Thou speak'st aright;
1514,I am that merry wanderer of the night.
1514,"I jest to Oberon, and make him smile,"
1514,"When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,"
1514,Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;
1514,"And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,"
1514,In very likeness of a roasted crab;
1514,"And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob,"
1514,And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.
1514,"The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,"
1514,Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
1514,"Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,"
1514,"And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;"
1514,"And then the whole quire hold their hips and loffe,"
1514,"And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear"
1514,A merrier hour was never wasted there.--
1514,"But room, fairy, here comes Oberon."
1514,
1514,FAIRY
1514,And here my mistress.--Would that he were gone!
1514,
1514,"[Enter OBERON at one door, with his Train, and TITANIA,"
1514,"at another, with hers.]"
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania."
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,"What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence;"
1514,I have forsworn his bed and company.
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?"
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,Then I must be thy lady; but I know
1514,"When thou hast stol'n away from fairy-land,"
1514,"And in the shape of Corin sat all day,"
1514,"Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love"
1514,"To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,"
1514,"Come from the farthest steep of India,"
1514,"But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,"
1514,"Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,"
1514,To Theseus must be wedded; and you come
1514,To give their bed joy and prosperity.
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"How canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,"
1514,"Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,"
1514,Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
1514,Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
1514,"From Perigenia, whom he ravish'd?"
1514,"And make him with fair Aegle break his faith,"
1514,With Ariadne and Antiopa?
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,These are the forgeries of jealousy:
1514,"And never, since the middle summer's spring,"
1514,"Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,"
1514,"By paved fountain, or by rushy brook,"
1514,"Or on the beached margent of the sea,"
1514,"To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,"
1514,But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
1514,"Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,"
1514,"As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea"
1514,"Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,"
1514,Hath every pelting river made so proud
1514,That they have overborne their continents:
1514,"The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,"
1514,The ploughman lost his sweat; and the green corn
1514,Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard:
1514,"The fold stands empty in the drowned field,"
1514,And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
1514,The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud;
1514,"And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,"
1514,"For lack of tread, are undistinguishable:"
1514,The human mortals want their winter here;
1514,No night is now with hymn or carol blest:--
1514,"Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,"
1514,"Pale in her anger, washes all the air,"
1514,That rheumatic diseases do abound:
1514,And thorough this distemperature we see
1514,The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
1514,Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;
1514,And on old Hyem's thin and icy crown
1514,An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
1514,"Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,"
1514,"The childing autumn, angry winter, change"
1514,"Their wonted liveries; and the maz'd world,"
1514,"By their increase, now knows not which is which:"
1514,And this same progeny of evils comes
1514,"From our debate, from our dissension:"
1514,We are their parents and original.
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"Do you amend it, then: it lies in you:"
1514,Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
1514,I do but beg a little changeling boy
1514,To be my henchman.
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,                   Set your heart at rest;
1514,The fairy-land buys not the child of me.
1514,His mother was a vot'ress of my order:
1514,"And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,"
1514,Full often hath she gossip'd by my side;
1514,"And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,"
1514,Marking the embarked traders on the flood;
1514,"When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive,"
1514,And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
1514,"Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait"
1514,"Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--"
1514,"Would imitate; and sail upon the land,"
1514,"To fetch me trifles, and return again,"
1514,"As from a voyage, rich with merchandise."
1514,"But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;"
1514,And for her sake do I rear up her boy:
1514,And for her sake I will not part with him.
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,How long within this wood intend you stay?
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
1514,"If you will patiently dance in our round,"
1514,"And see our moonlight revels, go with us;"
1514,"If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts."
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,Give me that boy and I will go with thee.
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,"Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away:"
1514,We shall chide downright if I longer stay.
1514,
1514,[Exit TITANIA with her Train.]
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove"
1514,Till I torment thee for this injury.--
1514,"My gentle Puck, come hither: thou remember'st"
1514,"Since once I sat upon a promontory,"
1514,"And heard a mermaid, on a dolphin's back,"
1514,"Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath,"
1514,"That the rude sea grew civil at her song,"
1514,And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
1514,To hear the sea-maid's music.
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,                              I remember.
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"That very time I saw,--but thou couldst not,--"
1514,"Flying between the cold moon and the earth,"
1514,"Cupid, all arm'd: a certain aim he took"
1514,"At a fair vestal, throned by the west;"
1514,"And loos'd his love-shaft smartly from his bow,"
1514,As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
1514,But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
1514,Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon;
1514,"And the imperial votaress passed on,"
1514,"In maiden meditation, fancy-free."
1514,Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
1514,"It fell upon a little western flower,--"
1514,"Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,--"
1514,And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
1514,"Fetch me that flower, the herb I showed thee once:"
1514,The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
1514,Will make or man or woman madly dote
1514,Upon the next live creature that it sees.
1514,Fetch me this herb: and be thou here again
1514,Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,I'll put a girdle round about the earth
1514,In forty minutes.
1514,
1514,[Exit PUCK.]
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"                  Having once this juice,"
1514,"I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,"
1514,And drop the liquor of it in her eyes:
1514,"The next thing then she waking looks upon,--"
1514,"Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,"
1514,"On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,--"
1514,She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
1514,"And ere I take this charm from off her sight,--"
1514,"As I can take it with another herb,"
1514,I'll make her render up her page to me.
1514,But who comes here? I am invisible;
1514,And I will overhear their conference.
1514,
1514,"[Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA following him.]"
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"I love thee not, therefore pursue me not."
1514,Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
1514,"The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me."
1514,"Thou told'st me they were stol'n into this wood,"
1514,"And here am I, and wode within this wood,"
1514,Because I cannot meet with Hermia.
1514,"Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more."
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;"
1514,"But yet you draw not iron, for my heart"
1514,"Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,"
1514,And I shall have no power to follow you.
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?
1514,"Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth"
1514,"Tell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?"
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,And even for that do I love you the more.
1514,"I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,"
1514,"The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:"
1514,"Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,"
1514,"Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,"
1514,"Unworthy as I am, to follow you."
1514,"What worser place can I beg in your love,"
1514,"And yet a place of high respect with me,--"
1514,Than to be used as you use your dog?
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
1514,For I am sick when I do look on thee.
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,And I am sick when I look not on you.
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"You do impeach your modesty too much,"
1514,"To leave the city, and commit yourself"
1514,Into the hands of one that loves you not;
1514,"To trust the opportunity of night,"
1514,"And the ill counsel of a desert place,"
1514,With the rich worth of your virginity.
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,Your virtue is my privilege for that.
1514,"It is not night when I do see your face,"
1514,Therefore I think I am not in the night;
1514,Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company;
1514,"For you, in my respect, are all the world:"
1514,Then how can it be said I am alone
1514,When all the world is here to look on me?
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"I'll run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,"
1514,And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
1514,"Run when you will, the story shall be chang'd;"
1514,"Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;"
1514,The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
1514,"Makes speed to catch the tiger,--bootless speed,"
1514,When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
1514,"Or, if thou follow me, do not believe"
1514,But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,"
1514,"You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!"
1514,Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
1514,We cannot fight for love as men may do:
1514,"We should be woo'd, and were not made to woo."
1514,"I'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,"
1514,To die upon the hand I love so well.
1514,
1514,[Exeunt DEMETRIUS and HELENA.]
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,"
1514,"Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.--"

1514,
1514,"Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer."
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"Ay, there it is."
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,                 I pray thee give it me.
1514,"I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows,"
1514,Where ox-lips and the nodding violet grows;
1514,"Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,"
1514,"With sweet musk-roses, and with eglantine:"
1514,"There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,"
1514,Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight;
1514,"And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,"
1514,Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
1514,"And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,"
1514,And make her full of hateful fantasies.
1514,"Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:"
1514,A sweet Athenian lady is in love
1514,With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
1514,But do it when the next thing he espies
1514,May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
1514,By the Athenian garments he hath on.
1514,"Effect it with some care, that he may prove"
1514,More fond on her than she upon her love:
1514,And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.

1514,Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds;
1514,"Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,"
1514,To make my small elves coats; and some keep back
1514,"The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots and wonders"
1514,At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;

1514,"We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,"
1514,  And tarry for the comfort of the day.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed,"
1514,For I upon this bank will rest my head.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
1514,"One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth."
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,"
1514,"Lie farther off yet, do not lie so near."
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence;"
1514,Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
1514,I mean that my heart unto yours is knit;
1514,So that but one heart we can make of it:
1514,Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
1514,So then two bosoms and a single troth.
1514,Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
1514,"For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie."
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,Lysander riddles very prettily:--
1514,Now much beshrew my manners and my pride
1514,If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied!
1514,"But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy"
1514,"Lie further off; in human modesty,"
1514,Such separation as may well be said
1514,Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid:
1514,"So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend:"
1514,Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"Amen, amen, to that fair prayer say I;"
1514,And then end life when I end loyalty!
1514,Here is my bed: Sleep give thee all his rest!
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,With half that wish the wisher's eyes be pressed!
1514,
1514,[They sleep.]

1514,  On whose eyes I might approve
1514,  This flower's force in stirring love.
1514,  Night and silence! Who is here?
1514,  Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
1514,"  This is he, my master said,"
1514,  Despised the Athenian maid;
1514,"  And here the maiden, sleeping sound,"
1514,  On the dank and dirty ground.
1514,  Pretty soul! she durst not lie
1514,"  Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy."
1514,"  Churl, upon thy eyes I throw"
1514,  All the power this charm doth owe;
1514,  When thou wak'st let love forbid
1514,  Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
1514,  So awake when I am gone;

1514,"Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies,"
1514,For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
1514,How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
1514,"If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers."
1514,"No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;"
1514,For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
1514,Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
1514,"Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus."
1514,What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
1514,Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?--
1514,But who is here?--Lysander! on the ground!
1514,"Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound."
1514,"Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake."
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,[Waking.]
1514,And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.

1514,"Do not say so, Lysander; say not so:"
1514,"What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?"
1514,Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER.
1514,Content with Hermia? No: I do repent
1514,The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
1514,Not Hermia but Helena I love:
1514,Who will not change a raven for a dove?
1514,The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
1514,And reason says you are the worthier maid.
1514,Things growing are not ripe until their season;
1514,"So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;"
1514,"And touching now the point of human skill,"
1514,"Reason becomes the marshal to my will,"

1514,HELENA
1514,Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
1514,When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?

1514,"That I did never, no, nor never can"
1514,"Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,"
1514,But you must flout my insufficiency?
1514,"Good troth, you do me wrong,--good sooth, you do--"
1514,In such disdainful manner me to woo.
1514,"But fare you well: perforce I must confess,"
1514,I thought you lord of more true gentleness.

1514,"For, as a surfeit of the sweetest things"
1514,The deepest loathing to the stomach brings;
1514,"Or, as the heresies that men do leave"
1514,Are hated most of those they did deceive;
1514,"So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,"

1514,"Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!"
1514,"What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?"
1514,"Alack, where are you? speak, an if you hear;"

1514,
1514,SCENE I. The Wood. The Queen of Fairies lying asleep.
1514,
1514,"[Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING.]"
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,Are we all met?
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our"
1514,"rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn"
1514,"brake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will"
1514,do it before the duke.
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Peter Quince,--"
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"What sayest thou, bully Bottom?"
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,There are things in this comedy of 'Pyramus and Thisby' that
1514,"will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill"
1514,himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?
1514,
1514,SNOUT
1514,"By'r lakin, a parlous fear."
1514,
1514,STARVELING
1514,"I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,Not a whit: I have a device to make all well. Write me a
1514,prologue; and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm
1514,"with our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for"
1514,"the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not"
1514,Pyramus but Bottom the weaver: this will put them out of fear.
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be"
1514,written in eight and six.
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight."
1514,
1514,SNOUT
1514,Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
1514,
1514,STARVELING
1514,"I fear it, I promise you."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to bring in,"
1514,God shield us! a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing:
1514,for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living;
1514,and we ought to look to it.
1514,
1514,SNOUT
1514,Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen"
1514,"through the lion's neck; and he himself must speak through,"
1514,"saying thus, or to the same defect,--'Ladies,' or, 'Fair ladies, I"
1514,"would wish you, or, I would request you, or, I would entreat you,"
1514,"not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I"
1514,"come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such"
1514,"thing; I am a man as other men are:'--and there, indeed, let him"
1514,"name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Well, it shall be so. But there is two hard things; that"
1514,"is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber: for, you know,"
1514,Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.
1514,
1514,SNOUT
1514,Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanack; find out"
1514,"moonshine, find out moonshine."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"Yes, it doth shine that night."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Why, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber-window,"
1514,"where we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement."
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a
1514,"lantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person"
1514,of moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a
1514,"wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby, says the"
1514,"story, did talk through the chink of a wall."
1514,
1514,SNOUT
1514,"You can never bring in a wall.--What say you, Bottom?"
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,Some man or other must present wall: and let him have
1514,"some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to"
1514,"signify wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that"
1514,cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.
1514,
1514,QUINCE
1514,"If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every"
1514,"mother's son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin:"
1514,"when you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so"
1514,every one according to his cue.

1514,"Near to her close and consecrated bower,"
1514,"While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,"
1514,"A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,"
1514,"That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,"
1514,Were met together to rehearse a play
1514,Intended for great Theseus' nuptial day.
1514,The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort
1514,"Who Pyramus presented in their sport,"
1514,Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake;
1514,"When I did him at this advantage take,"
1514,An ass's nowl I fix&egrave;d on his head;
1514,"Anon, his Thisbe must be answered,"
1514,"And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,"
1514,"As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,"
1514,"Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,"
1514,"Rising and cawing at the gun's report,"
1514,"Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,"
1514,So at his sight away his fellows fly:
1514,"And at our stamp here, o'er and o'er one falls;"
1514,"He murder cries, and help from Athens calls."
1514,"Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears, thus strong,"
1514,Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
1514,For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
1514,"Some sleeves, some hats: from yielders all things catch."
1514,"I led them on in this distracted fear,"
1514,And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
1514,"When in that moment,--so it came to pass,--"
1514,"Titania wak'd, and straightway lov'd an ass."
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,This falls out better than I could devise.
1514,But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
1514,"With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?"
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--"
1514,And the Athenian woman by his side;
1514,"That, when he wak'd, of force she must be ey'd."
1514,

1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?"
1514,Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"Now I but chide, but I should use thee worse;"
1514,"For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse."
1514,"If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,"
1514,"Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,"
1514,And kill me too.
1514,The sun was not so true unto the day
1514,As he to me: would he have stol'n away
1514,From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
1514,This whole earth may be bor'd; and that the moon
1514,May through the centre creep and so displease
1514,Her brother's noontide with the antipodes.
1514,It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
1514,"So should a murderer look; so dead, so grim."
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"So should the murder'd look; and so should I,"
1514,Pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty:
1514,"Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,"
1514,As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
1514,"Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?"
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"Out, dog! out, cur! thou driv'st me past the bounds"
1514,"Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?"
1514,Henceforth be never number'd among men!
1514,"Oh! once tell true; tell true, even for my sake;"
1514,"Durst thou have look'd upon him, being awake,"
1514,And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
1514,"Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?"
1514,An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
1514,"Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung."
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood:
1514,I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
1514,"Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell."
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"I pray thee, tell me, then, that he is well."
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"An if I could, what should I get therefore?"
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,A privilege never to see me more.--
1514,And from thy hated presence part I so:
1514,See me no more whether he be dead or no.

1514,

1514,There is no following her in this fierce vein:
1514,"Here, therefore, for a while I will remain."
1514,So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
1514,For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe;
1514,"Which now in some slight measure it will pay,"
1514,If for his tender here I make some stay.

1514,"What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite,"

1514,"Some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true."

1514,"  Lord, what fools these mortals be!"

1514,Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
1514,  Scorn and derision never come in tears.
1514,"Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,"
1514,  In their nativity all truth appears.
1514,"How can these things in me seem scorn to you,"
1514,"Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?"
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,You do advance your cunning more and more.
1514,"  When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!"
1514,These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
1514,"  Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:"
1514,"Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,"
1514,Will even weigh; and both as light as tales.

1514,I had no judgment when to her I swore.

1514,"That pure congealed white, high Taurus' snow,"
1514,"Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow"

1514,"This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!"
1514,

1514,O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
1514,To set against me for your merriment.
1514,"If you were civil, and knew courtesy,"
1514,You would not do me thus much injury.
1514,"Can you not hate me, as I know you do,"
1514,But you must join in souls to mock me too?
1514,"If you were men, as men you are in show,"
1514,You would not use a gentle lady so;
1514,"To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,"
1514,When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
1514,"You both are rivals, and love Hermia;"
1514,"And now both rivals, to mock Helena:"
1514,"A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,"
1514,To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
1514,With your derision! None of noble sort
1514,"Would so offend a virgin, and extort"
1514,"A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport."
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;"
1514,For you love Hermia: this you know I know:
1514,"And here, with all good will, with all my heart,"
1514,In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
1514,"And yours of Helena to me bequeath,"

1514,It pays the hearing double recompense:--
1514,"Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;"
1514,"Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound."
1514,But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,Why should he stay whom love doth press to go?
1514,

1514,"Fair Helena,--who more engilds the night"
1514,Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.

1514,Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
1514,To fashion this false sport in spite of me.
1514,Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
1514,"Have you conspir'd, have you with these contriv'd,"
1514,To bait me with this foul derision?
1514,"Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd,"
1514,"The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,"
1514,When we have chid the hasty-footed time
1514,"For parting us,--O, is all forgot?"
1514,"All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?"
1514,"We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,"
1514,"Have with our needles created both one flower,"
1514,"Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,"
1514,"Both warbling of one song, both in one key;"
1514,"As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,"
1514,"Had been incorporate. So we grew together,"
1514,"Like to a double cherry, seeming parted;"
1514,"But yet a union in partition,"
1514,Two lovely berries moulded on one stem:
1514,"So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;"
1514,"Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,"
1514,"Due but to one, and crowned with one crest."
1514,"And will you rent our ancient love asunder,"
1514,To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
1514,"It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:"
1514,"Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,"
1514,Though I alone do feel the injury.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,I am amazed at your passionate words:
1514,I scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,"
1514,"To follow me, and praise my eyes and face?"
1514,"And made your other love, Demetrius,--"
1514,"Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,--"
1514,"To call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare,"
1514,"Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this"
1514,To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
1514,"Deny your love, so rich within his soul,"
1514,"And tender me, forsooth, affection,"
1514,"But by your setting on, by your consent?"
1514,"What though I be not so in grace as you,"
1514,"So hung upon with love, so fortunate;"
1514,"But miserable most, to love unlov'd?"
1514,This you should pity rather than despise.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,I understand not what you mean by this.
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"Ay, do persever, counterfeit sad looks,"
1514,Make mows upon me when I turn my back;
1514,Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
1514,"This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled."
1514,"If you have any pity, grace, or manners,"
1514,You would not make me such an argument.
1514,But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
1514,"Which death, or absence, soon shall remedy."

1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"If she cannot entreat, I can compel."
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,Thou canst compel no more than she entreat;
1514,Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.--
1514,"Helen, I love thee; by my life I do;"
1514,I swear by that which I will lose for thee
1514,To prove him false that says I love thee not.
1514,

1514,I say I love thee more than he can do.

1514,But yet come not. You are a tame man; go!
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"Hang off, thou cat, thou burr: vile thing, let loose,"
1514,Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.
1514,

1514,"Why are you grown so rude? what change is this,"
1514,Sweet love?
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"            Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!"
1514,"Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!"
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,Do you not jest?
1514,

1514,LYSANDER
1514,"Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee."
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,I would I had your bond; for I perceive
1514,A weak bond holds you; I'll not trust your word.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"What! should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?"
1514,"Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so."
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,What! can you do me greater harm than hate?
1514,"Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love?"
1514,Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?
1514,I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
1514,Since night you lov'd me; yet since night you left me:
1514,"Why then, you left me,--O, the gods forbid!--"
1514,"In earnest, shall I say?"
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"                         Ay, by my life;"
1514,And never did desire to see thee more.
1514,"Therefore be out of hope, of question, doubt,"
1514,"Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest"
1514,That I do hate thee and love Helena.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,O me! you juggler! you cankerblossom!
1514,"You thief of love! What! have you come by night,"
1514,And stol'n my love's heart from him?
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"                                     Fine, i' faith!"
1514,"Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,"
1514,No touch of bashfulness? What! will you tear
1514,Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
1514,"Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!"
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"Puppet! why so? Ay, that way goes the game."
1514,Now I perceive that she hath made compare
1514,Between our statures; she hath urg'd her height;
1514,"And with her personage, her tall personage,"
1514,"Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.--"
1514,And are you grown so high in his esteem
1514,Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
1514,"How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;"
1514,How low am I? I am not yet so low
1514,But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,"
1514,Let her not hurt me. I was never curst;
1514,I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
1514,I am a right maid for my cowardice;
1514,"Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,"
1514,"Because she is something lower than myself,"
1514,That I can match her.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"                      Lower! hark, again."
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me."
1514,"I evermore did love you, Hermia;"
1514,Did ever keep your counsels; never wrong'd you;
1514,"Save that, in love unto Demetrius,"
1514,I told him of your stealth unto this wood:
1514,He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
1514,"But he hath chid me hence, and threaten'd me"
1514,"To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:"
1514,"And now, so you will let me quiet go,"
1514,"To Athens will I bear my folly back,"
1514,And follow you no farther. Let me go:
1514,You see how simple and how fond I am.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?"
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,A foolish heart that I leave here behind.
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,What! with Lysander?
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,                     With Demetrius.

1514,"No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part."
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd:"
1514,She was a vixen when she went to school;
1514,"And, though she be but little, she is fierce."
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,Little again! nothing but low and little!--
1514,Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
1514,Let me come to her.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"                    Get you gone, you dwarf;"
1514,"You minimus, of hind'ring knot-grass made;"
1514,"You bead, you acorn."

1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,                     You are too officious
1514,In her behalf that scorns your services.
1514,Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
1514,Take not her part; for if thou dost intend
1514,"Never so little show of love to her,"
1514,Thou shalt aby it.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,                   Now she holds me not;
1514,"Now follow, if thou dar'st, to try whose right,"
1514,"Of thine or mine, is most in Helena."
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole."
1514,
1514,[Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS.]
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:"
1514,"Nay, go not back."
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"                  I will not trust you, I;"
1514,Nor longer stay in your curst company.
1514,Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray;
1514,"My legs are longer though, to run away."
1514,
1514,[Exit.]
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"I am amaz'd, and know not what to say."
1514,
1514,"[Exit, pursuing HELENA.]"
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"This is thy negligence: still thou mistak'st,"
1514,Or else commit'st thy knaveries willfully.
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook."
1514,Did not you tell me I should know the man
1514,By the Athenian garments he had on?
1514,And so far blameless proves my enterprise
1514,That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes:
1514,"And so far am I glad it so did sort,"
1514,As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight;
1514,"Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;"
1514,The starry welkin cover thou anon
1514,"With drooping fog, as black as Acheron,"
1514,And lead these testy rivals so astray
1514,As one come not within another's way.
1514,"Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,"
1514,Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
1514,And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
1514,"And from each other look thou lead them thus,"
1514,Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
1514,With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
1514,Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
1514,"Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,"
1514,To take from thence all error with his might
1514,And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
1514,"When they next wake, all this derision"
1514,Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision;
1514,And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
1514,With league whose date till death shall never end.
1514,"Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,"
1514,"I'll to my queen, and beg her Indian boy;"
1514,And then I will her charmed eye release
1514,"From monster's view, and all things shall be peace."
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,"
1514,For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast;
1514,"And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger,"
1514,"At whose approach ghosts, wandering here and there,"
1514,"Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,"
1514,"That in cross-ways and floods have burial,"
1514,Already to their wormy beds are gone;
1514,For fear lest day should look their shames upon
1514,"They wilfully exile themselves from light,"
1514,And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,But we are spirits of another sort:
1514,I with the morning's love have oft made sport;
1514,"And, like a forester, the groves may tread"
1514,"Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,"
1514,"Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,"
1514,Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams.
1514,"But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:"
1514,We may effect this business yet ere day.
1514,
1514,[Exit OBERON.]
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"  Up and down, up and down;"
1514,  I will lead them up and down:
1514,  I am fear'd in field and town.
1514,"  Goblin, lead them up and down."
1514,Here comes one.
1514,
1514,[Enter LYSANDER.]
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now."
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?"
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,I will be with thee straight.
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"                              Follow me, then,"
1514,To plainer ground.
1514,
1514,[Exit LYSANDER as following the voice.]
1514,
1514,[Enter DEMETRIUS.]
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,                   Lysander! speak again.
1514,"Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?"
1514,Speak. In some bush? where dost thou hide thy head?
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,"
1514,"Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,"
1514,"And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;"
1514,I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
1514,That draws a sword on thee.
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"                            Yea, art thou there?"
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,Follow my voice; we'll try no manhood here.
1514,
1514,[Exeunt.]
1514,
1514,[Re-enter LYSANDER.]
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"He goes before me, and still dares me on;"
1514,"When I come where he calls, then he is gone."
1514,The villain is much lighter heeled than I:
1514,"I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;"
1514,"That fallen am I in dark uneven way,"
1514,"And here will rest me.  Come, thou gentle day!"
1514,[Lies down.]
1514,"For if but once thou show me thy grey light,"
1514,"I'll find Demetrius, and revenge this spite."
1514,
1514,[Sleeps.]
1514,
1514,[Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS.]
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"Ho, ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com'st thou not?"
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"Abide me, if thou dar'st; for well I wot"
1514,"Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place;"
1514,"And dar'st not stand, nor look me in the face."
1514,Where art thou?
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,                Come hither; I am here.
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"Nay, then, thou mock'st me."
1514,"Thou shalt buy this dear,"
1514,If ever I thy face by daylight see:
1514,"Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me"
1514,To measure out my length on this cold bed.--
1514,By day's approach look to be visited.
1514,
1514,[Lies down and sleeps.]
1514,
1514,[Enter HELENA.]
1514,
1514,HELENA
1514,"O weary night, O long and tedious night,"
1514,"Abate thy hours! Shine comforts from the east,"
1514,"That I may back to Athens by daylight,"
1514,From these that my poor company detest:--
1514,"And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,"
1514,Steal me awhile from mine own company.
1514,
1514,[Sleeps.]
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,  Yet but three? Come one more;
1514,  Two of both kinds makes up four.
1514,"  Here she comes, curst and sad:--"
1514,"  Cupid is a knavish lad,"
1514,  Thus to make poor females mad.
1514,
1514,[Enter HERMIA.]
1514,
1514,HERMIA
1514,"Never so weary, never so in woe,"
1514,"  Bedabbled with the dew, and torn with briers;"
1514,"I can no further crawl, no further go;"
1514,  My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
1514,Here will I rest me till the break of day.
1514,"Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!"
1514,
1514,[Lies down.]
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,  On the ground
1514,  Sleep sound:
1514,  I'll apply
1514,"  To your eye,"
1514,"  Gentle lover, remedy."
1514,
1514,[Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER'S eye.]
1514,
1514,"  When thou wak'st,"
1514,  Thou tak'st
1514,  True delight
1514,  In the sight
1514,Of thy former lady's eye:
1514,"And the country proverb known,"
1514,"That every man should take his own,"
1514,In your waking shall be shown:
1514,  Jack shall have Jill;
1514,  Nought shall go ill;
1514,"The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well."

1514,ACT IV
1514,
1514,SCENE I. The Wood.
1514,
1514,"[Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH,"
1514,"MUSTARDSEED, and other FAIRIES attending; OBERON behind, unseen.]"
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,"Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,"
1514,"  While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,"
1514,"And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,"
1514,"  And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,Where's Peasblossom?
1514,
1514,PEASBLOSSOM
1514,Ready.
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Scratch my head, Peasblossom.--"
1514,Where's Monsieur Cobweb?
1514,
1514,COBWEB
1514,Ready.
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Monsieur Cobweb; good monsieur, get you your weapons in"
1514,your hand and kill me a red-hipped humble-bee on the top of a
1514,"thistle; and, good monsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not"
1514,"fret yourself too much in the action, monsieur; and, good"
1514,"monsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not; I would be"
1514,"loath to have you overflown with a honey-bag, signior.--"
1514,Where's Monsieur Mustardseed?
1514,
1514,MUSTARDSEED
1514,Ready.
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Give me your neif, Monsieur Mustardseed."
1514,"Pray you, leave your curtsy, good monsieur."
1514,
1514,MUSTARDSEED
1514,What's your will?
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Nothing, good monsieur, but to help Cavalero Cobweb to"
1514,"scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for methinks I am"
1514,"marvellous hairy about the face; and I am such a tender ass,"
1514,if my hair do but tickle me I must scratch.
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,"What, wilt thou hear some music, my sweet love?"
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,I have a reasonable good ear in music; let us have the
1514,tongs and the bones.
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,"Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"Truly, a peck of provender; I could munch your good dry"
1514,oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay: good
1514,"hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow."
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
1514,"The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas. But,"
1514,"I pray you, let none of your people stir me; I have an"
1514,exposition of sleep come upon me.
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,"Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms."
1514,"Fairies, be gone, and be all ways away."
1514,So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
1514,"Gently entwist,--the female ivy so"
1514,Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
1514,"O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!"
1514,
1514,[They sleep.]
1514,
1514,[OBERON advances. Enter PUCK.]
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"Welcome, good Robin. Seest thou this sweet sight?"
1514,Her dotage now I do begin to pity.
1514,"For, meeting her of late behind the wood,"
1514,"Seeking sweet favours for this hateful fool,"
1514,I did upbraid her and fall out with her:
1514,For she his hairy temples then had rounded
1514,With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
1514,"And that same dew, which sometime on the buds"
1514,"Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,"
1514,"Stood now within the pretty flow'rets' eyes,"
1514,Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
1514,"When I had, at my pleasure, taunted her,"
1514,"And she, in mild terms, begg'd my patience,"
1514,I then did ask of her her changeling child;
1514,"Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent"
1514,To bear him to my bower in fairy-land.
1514,"And now I have the boy, I will undo"
1514,This hateful imperfection of her eyes.
1514,"And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp"
1514,"From off the head of this Athenian swain,"
1514,"That he awaking when the other do,"
1514,"May all to Athens back again repair,"
1514,And think no more of this night's accidents
1514,But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
1514,But first I will release the fairy queen.
1514,  Be as thou wast wont to be;
1514,[Touching her eyes with an herb.]
1514,  See as thou was wont to see.
1514,  Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
1514,  Hath such force and blessed power.
1514,"Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen."
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
1514,Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,There lies your love.
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,                      How came these things to pass?
1514,"O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!"
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"Silence awhile.--Robin, take off this head."
1514,"Titania, music call; and strike more dead"
1514,"Than common sleep, of all these five, the sense."
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,"Music, ho! music; such as charmeth sleep."
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"Now when thou wak'st, with thine own fool's eyes peep."
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"Sound, music. [Still music.] Come, my queen, take hands with me,"
1514,And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
1514,"Now thou and I are new in amity,"
1514,And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
1514,"Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,"
1514,And bless it to all fair prosperity:
1514,There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
1514,"Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity."
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"Fairy king, attend and mark;"
1514,I do hear the morning lark.
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"  Then, my queen, in silence sad,"
1514,  Trip we after night's shade.
1514,"  We the globe can compass soon,"
1514,  Swifter than the wand'ring moon.
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,"  Come, my lord; and in our flight,"
1514,  Tell me how it came this night
1514,  That I sleeping here was found
1514,  With these mortals on the ground.
1514,
1514,[Exeunt. Horns sound within.]
1514,
1514,"[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and Train.]"
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"Go, one of you, find out the forester;--"
1514,For now our observation is perform'd;
1514,"And since we have the vaward of the day,"
1514,"My love shall hear the music of my hounds,--"
1514,Uncouple in the western valley; go:--
1514,"Despatch, I say, and find the forester.--"
1514,
1514,[Exit an ATTENDANT.]
1514,
1514,"We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,"
1514,And mark the musical confusion
1514,Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
1514,
1514,HIPPOLYTA
1514,I was with Hercules and Cadmus once
1514,When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
1514,With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
1514,"Such gallant chiding; for, besides the groves,"
1514,"The skies, the fountains, every region near"
1514,Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
1514,"So musical a discord, such sweet thunder."
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,"
1514,"So flew'd, so sanded; and their heads are hung"
1514,With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
1514,Crook-knee'd and dew-lap'd like Thessalian bulls;
1514,"Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,"
1514,Each under each. A cry more tuneable
1514,"Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,"
1514,"In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly."
1514,"Judge when you hear.--But, soft, what nymphs are these?"
1514,
1514,EGEUS
1514,"My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;"
1514,And this Lysander; this Demetrius is;
1514,"This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:"
1514,I wonder of their being here together.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,No doubt they rose up early to observe
1514,"The rite of May; and, hearing our intent,"
1514,Came here in grace of our solemnity.--
1514,"But speak, Egeus; is not this the day"
1514,That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
1514,
1514,EGEUS
1514,"It is, my lord."
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns."
1514,
1514,"[Horns, and shout within. DEMETRIUS, LYSANDER,HERMIA, and HELENA"
1514,awake and start up.]
1514,
1514,"Good-morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past;"
1514,Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"Pardon, my lord."
1514,
1514,[He and the rest kneel to THESEUS.]
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"                 I pray you all, stand up."
1514,I know you two are rival enemies;
1514,"How comes this gentle concord in the world,"
1514,That hatred is so far from jealousy
1514,"To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?"
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"My lord, I shall reply amazedly,"
1514,"Half 'sleep, half waking; but as yet, I swear,"
1514,I cannot truly say how I came here:
1514,"But, as I think,--for truly would I speak--"
1514,"And now I do bethink me, so it is,--"
1514,I came with Hermia hither: our intent
1514,"Was to be gone from Athens, where we might be,"
1514,Without the peril of the Athenian law.
1514,
1514,EGEUS
1514,"Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough;"
1514,"I beg the law, the law upon his head.--"
1514,"They would have stol'n away, they would, Demetrius,"
1514,Thereby to have defeated you and me:
1514,"You of your wife, and me of my consent,--"
1514,Of my consent that she should be your wife.
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,"
1514,Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
1514,"And I in fury hither follow'd them,"
1514,Fair Helena in fancy following me.
1514,"But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--"
1514,"But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,"
1514,Melted as the snow--seems to me now
1514,As the remembrance of an idle gawd
1514,Which in my childhood I did dote upon:
1514,"And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,"
1514,"The object and the pleasure of mine eye,"
1514,"Is only Helena. To her, my lord,"
1514,Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
1514,"But, like a sickness, did I loathe this food;"
1514,"But, as in health, come to my natural taste,"
1514,"Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,"
1514,And will for evermore be true to it.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:"
1514,Of this discourse we more will hear anon.--
1514,"Egeus, I will overbear your will;"
1514,"For in the temple, by and by with us,"
1514,These couples shall eternally be knit.
1514,"And, for the morning now is something worn,"
1514,Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside.--
1514,"Away with us to Athens, three and three,"
1514,We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.--
1514,"Come, Hippolyta."
1514,
1514,"[Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and Train.]"
1514,

1514,"stol'n hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare"
1514,vision. I have had a dream--past the wit of man to say
1514,what dream it was.--Man is but an ass if he go about
1514,to expound this dream. Methought I was--there is no man can tell
1514,"what. Methought I was, and methought I had,--but man is but a"
1514,"patched fool, if he will offer to say what methought I had. The"
1514,"eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen; man's"
1514,"hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart"
1514,"to report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a"
1514,"ballad of this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream, because"
1514,it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a

1514,"'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of."
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,More strange than true. I never may believe
1514,"These antique fables, nor these fairy toys."
1514,"Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,"
1514,"Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend"
1514,More than cool reason ever comprehends.
1514,"The lunatic, the lover, and the poet"
1514,Are of imagination all compact:
1514,One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;
1514,"That is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,"
1514,Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
1514,"The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,"
1514,"Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;"
1514,And as imagination bodies forth
1514,"The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen"
1514,"Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing"
1514,A local habitation and a name.
1514,"Such tricks hath strong imagination,"
1514,"That, if it would but apprehend some joy,"
1514,It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
1514,"Or in the night, imagining some fear,"
1514,How easy is a bush supposed a bear?
1514,
1514,HIPPOLYTA
1514,"But all the story of the night told over,"
1514,"And all their minds transfigur'd so together,"

1514,"Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,"
1514,To wear away this long age of three hours
1514,Between our after-supper and bed-time?
1514,Where is our usual manager of mirth?
1514,What revels are in hand? Is there no play

1514,  Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
1514,"That is an old device, and it was play'd"
1514,When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
1514,  'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
1514,"  Of learning, late deceas'd in beggary.'"
1514,"That is some satire, keen and critical,"
1514,Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
1514,  'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
1514,  And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
1514,Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
1514,That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
1514,How shall we find the concord of this discord?
1514,
1514,PHILOSTRATE
1514,"A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,"
1514,Which is as brief as I have known a play;
1514,"But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,"
1514,Which makes it tedious: for in all the play
1514,"There is not one word apt, one player fitted:"
1514,"And tragical, my noble lord, it is;"
1514,For Pyramus therein doth kill himself:
1514,"Which when I saw rehears'd, I must confess,"
1514,Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
1514,The passion of loud laughter never shed.
1514,

1514,What are they that do play it?
1514,

1514,"                     No, my noble lord,"
1514,"It is not for you: I have heard it over,"

1514,"Unless you can find sport in their intents,"
1514,"Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,"
1514,To do you service.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,                   I will hear that play;

1514,To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
1514,"Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,"
1514,"Make periods in the midst of sentences,"
1514,"Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears,"
1514,"And, in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,"
1514,"Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,"
1514,Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
1514,And in the modesty of fearful duty
1514,I read as much as from the rattling tongue
1514,Of saucy and audacious eloquence.

1514,"  That you should think, we come not to offend,"
1514,"But with good will.  To show our simple skill,"
1514,  That is the true beginning of our end.
1514,"Consider then, we come but in despite."
1514,"  We do not come, as minding to content you,"
1514,Our true intent is.  All for your delight
1514,"  We are not here.  That you should here repent you,"
1514,"The actors are at hand: and, by their show,"
1514,"You shall know all that you are like to know,'"

1514,This fellow doth not stand upon points.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
1514,"not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak,"
1514,but to speak true.
1514,
1514,HIPPOLYTA
1514,Indeed he hath played on this prologue like a child
1514,"on a recorder; a sound, but not in government."
1514,

1514,  This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
1514,"This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present"
1514,"  Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;"
1514,"And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content"
1514,"  To whisper, at the which let no man wonder."
1514,"This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,"
1514,"  Presenteth Moonshine: for, if you will know,"
1514,By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
1514,"  To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo."
1514,"This grisly beast, which by name Lion hight,"
1514,"The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,"
1514,"Did scare away, or rather did affright;"
1514,"And as she fled, her mantle she did fall;"
1514,  Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain:
1514,"Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth, and tall,"
1514,  And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;
1514,"Whereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,"
1514,  He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;
1514,"And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,"
1514,"  His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,"
1514,"Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,"
1514,At large discourse while here they do remain.

1514,"Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,"
1514,Did whisper often very secretly.
1514,"This loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show"
1514,That I am that same wall; the truth is so:

1514,He should have worn the horns on his head.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"He is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within"
1514,the circumference.
1514,
1514,MOONSHINE
1514,This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
1514,Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man should be
1514,put into the lantern. How is it else the man i' the moon?
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"He dares not come there for the candle: for, you"
1514,"see, it is already in snuff."
1514,
1514,HIPPOLYTA
1514,I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"It appears, by his small light of discretion, that he"
1514,"is in the wane: but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must"
1514,stay the time.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"Proceed, moon."
1514,
1514,MOON
1514,"All that I have to say, is to tell you that the lantern"
1514,"is the moon; I, the man i' the moon; this thorn-bush, my"
1514,"thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog."
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"Why, all these should be in the lantern; for all"
1514,these are in the moon. But silence; here comes Thisbe.
1514,
1514,[Enter THISBE.]
1514,
1514,THISBE
1514,This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
1514,
1514,LION
1514,Oh!
1514,
1514,[The LION roars.--THISBE runs off.]
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"Well roared, lion."
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"Well run, Thisbe."
1514,
1514,HIPPOLYTA
1514,"Well shone, moon.--Truly, the moon shines with a good grace."
1514,
1514,"[The LION tears THISBE'S Mantle, and exit.]"
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"Well moused, lion."
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,And so comes Pyramus.
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,And then the lion vanishes.
1514,
1514,[Enter PYRAMUS.]
1514,
1514,PYRAMUS
1514,"Sweet moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;"
1514,"  I thank thee, moon, for shining now so bright:"
1514,"For, by thy gracious golden, glittering streams,"
1514,  I trust to take of truest Thisby's sight.
1514,      But stay;--O spite!
1514,"      But mark,--poor knight,"
1514,    What dreadful dole is here!
1514,"      Eyes, do you see?"
1514,      How can it be?
1514,    O dainty duck! O dear!
1514,"      Thy mantle good,"
1514,      What! stained with blood?
1514,"    Approach, ye furies fell!"
1514,"      O fates! come, come;"
1514,      Cut thread and thrum;
1514,"    Quail, rush, conclude, and quell!"
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go"
1514,near to make a man look sad.
1514,
1514,HIPPOLYTA
1514,"Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man."
1514,
1514,PYRAMUS
1514,"O wherefore, nature, didst thou lions frame?"
1514,  Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear;
1514,"Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame"
1514,"  That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that look'd with cheer."
1514,"      Come, tears, confound;"
1514,"      Out, sword, and wound"
1514,    The pap of Pyramus:
1514,"      Ay, that left pap,"
1514,      Where heart doth hop:--
1514,"    Thus die I, thus, thus, thus."
1514,"      Now am I dead,"
1514,      Now am I fled;
1514,    My soul is in the sky:
1514,"      Tongue, lose thy light!"
1514,"      Moon, take thy flight!"
1514,"    Now die, die, die, die, die."
1514,
1514,[Dies. Exit MOONSHINE.]
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one."
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,"Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing."
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass.
1514,
1514,HIPPOLYTA
1514,How chance moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
1514,back and finds her lover?
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,She will find him by starlight.--Here she comes; and
1514,her passion ends the play.
1514,
1514,[Enter THISBE.]
1514,
1514,HIPPOLYTA
1514,Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
1514,Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which"
1514,"Thisbe, is the better."
1514,
1514,LYSANDER
1514,She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"And thus she moans, videlicet.--"
1514,
1514,THISBE
1514,"     Asleep, my love?"
1514,"     What, dead, my dove?"
1514,"   O Pyramus, arise,"
1514,"     Speak, speak. Quite dumb?"
1514,"     Dead, dead? A tomb"
1514,   Must cover thy sweet eyes.
1514,"     These lily lips,"
1514,"     This cherry nose,"
1514,"   These yellow cowslip cheeks,"
1514,"     Are gone, are gone:"
1514,"     Lovers, make moan!"
1514,   His eyes were green as leeks.
1514,"     O Sisters Three,"
1514,"     Come, come to me,"
1514,   With hands as pale as milk;
1514,"     Lay them in gore,"
1514,     Since you have shore
1514,   With shears his thread of silk.
1514,"     Tongue, not a word:--"
1514,"     Come, trusty sword;"
1514,"   Come, blade, my breast imbrue;"
1514,"     And farewell, friends:--"
1514,     Thus Thisbe ends;
1514,"   Adieu, adieu, adieu."
1514,
1514,[Dies.]
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,Moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead.
1514,
1514,DEMETRIUS
1514,"Ay, and wall too."
1514,
1514,BOTTOM
1514,"No, I assure you; the wall is down that parted their fathers."
1514,"Will it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask"
1514,dance between two of our company?
1514,
1514,THESEUS
1514,"No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no"
1514,excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all dead there
1514,"need none to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had played"
1514,"Pyramus, and hang'd himself in Thisbe's garter, it would have"
1514,"been a fine tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably"
1514,"discharged. But come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone."
1514,
1514,[Here a dance of Clowns.]
1514,
1514,The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:--
1514,"Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time."
1514,"I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn,"
1514,As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
1514,This palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd
1514,"The heavy gait of night.--Sweet friends, to bed.--"
1514,"A fortnight hold we this solemnity,"
1514,In nightly revels and new jollity.
1514,
1514,[Exeunt.]

1514,
1514,SCENE II
1514,
1514,[Enter PUCK.]
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"  Now the hungry lion roars,"
1514,   And the wolf behowls the moon;
1514,"  Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,"
1514,   All with weary task fordone.
1514,"  Now the wasted brands do glow,"
1514,"   Whilst the scritch-owl, scritching loud,"
1514,  Puts the wretch that lies in woe
1514,   In remembrance of a shroud.
1514,  Now it is the time of night
1514,"   That the graves, all gaping wide,"
1514,"  Every one lets forth its sprite,"
1514,   In the church-way paths to glide:
1514,"  And we fairies, that do run"
1514,   By the triple Hecate's team
1514,"  From the presence of the sun,"
1514,"   Following darkness like a dream,"
1514,  Now are frolic; not a mouse
1514,   Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
1514,"  I am sent with broom before,"
1514,   To sweep the dust behind the door.
1514,
1514,"[Enter OBERON and TITANIA, with their Train.]"
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"  Through the house give glimmering light,"
1514,    By the dead and drowsy fire:
1514,  Every elf and fairy sprite
1514,    Hop as light as bird from brier:
1514,"  And this ditty, after me,"
1514,  Sing and dance it trippingly.
1514,
1514,TITANIA
1514,"  First, rehearse your song by rote,"
1514,    To each word a warbling note;
1514,"  Hand in hand, with fairy grace,"
1514,"  Will we sing, and bless this place."
1514,
1514,[Song and Dance.]
1514,
1514,OBERON
1514,"  Now, until the break of day,"
1514,"  Through this house each fairy stray,"
1514,"  To the best bride-bed will we,"
1514,  Which by us shall blessed be;
1514,  And the issue there create
1514,  Ever shall be fortunate.
1514,  So shall all the couples three
1514,  Ever true in loving be;
1514,  And the blots of Nature's hand
1514,  Shall not in their issue stand:
1514,"  Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,"
1514,"  Nor mark prodigious, such as are"
1514,"  Despised in nativity,"
1514,  Shall upon their children be.--
1514,"  With this field-dew consecrate,"
1514,  Every fairy take his gate;
1514,"  And each several chamber bless,"
1514,"  Through this palace, with sweet peace;"
1514,"  E'er shall it in safety rest,"
1514,  And the owner of it blest.
1514,    Trip away:
1514,    Make no stay:
1514,  Meet me all by break of day.
1514,
1514,"[Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and Train.]"
1514,
1514,PUCK
1514,"  If we shadows have offended,"
1514,"  Think but this,--and all is mended,--"
1514,  That you have but slumber'd here
1514,  While these visions did appear.
1514,"  And this weak and idle theme,"
1514,"  No more yielding but a dream,"
1514,"  Gentles, do not reprehend;"
1514,"  If you pardon, we will mend."
1514,"  And, as I am an honest Puck,"
1514,  If we have unearned luck
1514,"  Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,"
1514,  We will make amends ere long;
1514,  Else the Puck a liar call:
1514,"  So, good night unto you all."
1514,"  Give me your hands, if we be friends,"
1514,  And Robin shall restore amends.
